dia7_utt0.wav	Yeah, but without the costumes.	1
dia7_utt1.wav	Oh.	1
dia7_utt2.wav	And its not fake, its totally brutal.	1

dia7_utt6.wav	Whats fish hooking?	0
dia7_utt7.wav	Huh, whats fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?	1
dia7_utt8.wav	What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.	1
dia8_utt0.wav	Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.	0
dia8_utt1.wav	Well, that makes me feel so good.	2
dia8_utt2.wav	It was just so awkward and bumpy.	1
dia8_utt3.wav	Bumpy?	0
dia8_utt4.wav	Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.	1
dia8_utt5.wav	And uh maybe you have to get used to it.	1
dia8_utt6.wav	Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?	2
dia9_utt0.wav	Coming through!  Oh! Coming through!  Oh! Hello! Hi!  No! Right! Coming through!	0
dia9_utt1.wav	Oh well, its not so bad.	1

dia9_utt3.wav	Oh!	0
dia9_utt4.wav	My God!	0
dia9_utt5.wav	Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?	1

dia9_utt16.wav	Yes, they can stay with us.	1
dia9_utt17.wav	Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?	1
dia10_utt0.wav	Theres just so much pressure.	0
dia10_utt1.wav	I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.	1
dia10_utt2.wav	I dont know if youd understand.	1
dia10_utt3.wav	Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.	1
dia11_utt0.wav	Well Phoebe, we gotta do something!	0
dia11_utt1.wav	I mean theres no way Joeys gonna make it in time.	0
dia11_utt2.wav	So Im gonna go through the hotel and see if theres any other weddings going on.	1
dia11_utt3.wav	Okay. Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant because they frown on that.	1
dia11_utt4.wav	Okay.	1
dia12_utt0.wav	Whats all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!	0
dia12_utt1.wav	Ross, we can handle this.	1
dia12_utt2.wav	Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.	0
dia12_utt3.wav	I mean, enough of the silliness!	0
dia12_utt4.wav	Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly!	0
dia12_utt5.wav	Okay-okay!	0
dia12_utt6.wav	Two very good points, look Ive known you both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together.	0
dia12_utt7.wav	Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?	0
dia12_utt8.wav	That is so silly.	2
dia12_utt9.wav	Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?	1
dia12_utt10.wav	Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.	1
dia12_utt11.wav	Love is the best medicine.	2
dia12_utt12.wav	Thats laughter.	2
dia12_utt13.wav	Why do you do it?	1
dia12_utt14.wav	I dont know.	1
dia12_utt15.wav	Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?	1
dia12_utt16.wav	Yeah, I do.	1
dia12_utt17.wav	And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, dont ya?	1
dia12_utt18.wav	Yes.	1
dia12_utt19.wav	Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!	2
dia13_utt0.wav	Oh.	1
dia13_utt1.wav	But I don't. Me, Phoebe.	1
dia13_utt2.wav	Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.	1
dia13_utt3.wav	You're not? See, that's why you're so great!	2
dia13_utt4.wav	Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.	1
dia13_utt5.wav	Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!	0
dia13_utt6.wav	Define me!	0
dia13_utt7.wav	Love me, I need love!	0
dia14_utt0.wav	Have you really done this before?	2
dia14_utt1.wav	Yeah!	2
dia14_utt2.wav	Yeah!	2
dia14_utt3.wav	Yeah!	2

dia14_utt6.wav	Hey!	2
dia14_utt7.wav	Hey-hey-hey!	2

dia14_utt10.wav	Oh, all right.	1
dia15_utt0.wav	Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.	2
dia15_utt1.wav	Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.	2
dia15_utt2.wav	Okay!	2
dia15_utt3.wav	Bye!	1
dia15_utt4.wav	Bye!	1
dia15_utt5.wav	Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!	0
dia16_utt0.wav	Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?	1
dia16_utt1.wav	Listen uh, Id prefer it if you didnt call me Joey.	1
dia16_utt2.wav	Since I dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.	1
dia16_utt3.wav	Hey, dragon! Heres your tips from Monday and Tuesday.	1
dia16_utt4.wav	Theres like-theres like 300 bucks in this one!	0

dia16_utt6.wav	Could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials?	1
dia16_utt7.wav	Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy is nobody writing these down?	1
dia16_utt8.wav	Because we can remember them.	1
dia16_utt9.wav	Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?	0
dia17_utt0.wav	Hey. When you guys were kids and you played	1
dia17_utt1.wav	I was always Joanne.	1
dia17_utt2.wav	Question. Was ah, Egg the Gellers! the war cry of your neighbourhood?	1

dia17_utt4.wav	Dont look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!	0
dia17_utt5.wav	Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.	2
dia17_utt6.wav	What a wank!	0
dia17_utt7.wav	Oh, I cannot believe hes using our divorce to sell mattresses.	0
dia17_utt8.wav	I know!	0
dia17_utt9.wav	And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves.	0
dia17_utt10.wav	And Im appalled for you by the way.	0
dia17_utt11.wav	You had to do it, didnt you? You couldnt just leave it alone.	0
dia17_utt12.wav	Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when theres a bug in my food.	0

dia17_utt16.wav	Im, Im freaking out!	0
dia17_utt17.wav	Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldnt have!	0
dia17_utt18.wav	All right, I havent lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.	1
dia17_utt19.wav	Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?	1
dia17_utt20.wav	Um. yeah.	1
dia17_utt21.wav	I am	1
dia17_utt22.wav	All right, look, heres the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.	1
dia17_utt23.wav	So, Ill invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.	1
dia17_utt24.wav	Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesnt work.	0
dia17_utt25.wav	Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but thats why you have got to be the bigger man here.	1
dia17_utt26.wav	Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say Like me!	0
dia17_utt27.wav	Like me tiny doctor!	0
dia17_utt28.wav	Okay, well cant you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?	0
dia17_utt29.wav	Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay were never gonna get along.	0
dia17_utt30.wav	Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.	0
dia17_utt31.wav	Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I dont wanna have to have a separate room for you too!	0
dia17_utt32.wav	Okay, okay, okay.  Ill get the bagels.	1
dia18_utt0.wav	Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?	1
dia18_utt1.wav	All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.	1
dia18_utt2.wav	Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.	1
dia19_utt0.wav	Really? A purse?	2
dia20_utt0.wav	It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.	0

dia20_utt2.wav	No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,	1
dia20_utt3.wav	See look,	1

dia107_utt12.wav	Come on you gotta have one!	2
dia108_utt0.wav	Ugh!	0
dia108_utt3.wav	I mean if you buy a bed from Janices ex-husband, thats like betraying Chandler.	0
dia108_utt4.wav	Not at these prices.	0
dia108_utt5.wav	Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store.  Woo!	2
dia108_utt6.wav	Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.	2
dia108_utt7.wav	Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandlers your friend...  Oh!	2
dia108_utt8.wav	Oh my God!	2
dia108_utt9.wav	Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.	2
dia109_utt0.wav	You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.	2
dia109_utt1.wav	Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?	2
dia109_utt2.wav	By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.	0
dia109_utt3.wav	That's OK.	1
dia109_utt4.wav	Oh, are you sure?	2
dia109_utt5.wav	Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.	0
dia109_utt6.wav	We can't do that.	1
dia109_utt7.wav	What? What can't you do?	0
dia110_utt0.wav	She really said that?	2
dia110_utt1.wav	Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part...	1
dia110_utt2.wav	But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.	1
dia110_utt3.wav	'Tonight' tonight?	2
dia110_utt4.wav	Well, I think it's perfect.	2
dia110_utt5.wav	Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...	1
dia110_utt6.wav	I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.	0
dia110_utt7.wav	Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.	2
dia110_utt8.wav	Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.	0
dia111_utt0.wav	Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?	1
dia111_utt1.wav	No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.	1
dia111_utt2.wav	Alright, well, be good, I love you.	2
dia111_utt3.wav	You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.	0
dia111_utt4.wav	O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.	0
dia111_utt5.wav	Really stupid.	0
dia111_utt6.wav	Really stupid.	0
dia111_utt7.wav	And I don't even know how it happened.	0
dia111_utt8.wav	I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again.	0
dia111_utt9.wav	Are we okay now?	0
dia111_utt10.wav	Yeah. No. No...	0
dia111_utt11.wav	Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.	1
dia111_utt12.wav	Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.	1
dia111_utt13.wav	You're kidding.	0
dia111_utt14.wav	"No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"""	1
dia112_utt0.wav	Oh there it is.	1
dia112_utt1.wav	Thats not your regular dry cleaners.	1
dia112_utt2.wav	I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one.	0
dia112_utt3.wav	I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store	0
dia112_utt4.wav	What?!	0
dia112_utt5.wav	A new grocery store.	1
dia112_utt6.wav	The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and thats what they gave me?	0
dia112_utt7.wav	When I get up there Im going to kick some ass.	0
dia112_utt8.wav	Dont worry Phoebe, youre gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.	1
dia112_utt9.wav	Yeah, we both can. And we both will.	1
dia112_utt10.wav	Oh, you didnt have to come in with me.	1

dia112_utt16.wav	I hope you dont think Im crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?	2
dia112_utt17.wav	A little.   Now youre talking.	1
dia112_utt18.wav	Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?	1

dia114_utt5.wav	Thursdays clearly not good for ya, pick a day!	2
dia115_utt0.wav	So thats two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.	2

dia115_utt2.wav	Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.	0
dia115_utt3.wav	Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.	0

dia118_utt10.wav	Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?	2
dia118_utt11.wav	Well, the heart wants what it wants. Ill see you later.	1
dia119_utt0.wav	Okay, I got that. Ill escape over there. Ill come back over here. All right, come on	1

dia120_utt2.wav	With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time!	2
dia120_utt3.wav	And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!!	2
dia120_utt4.wav	Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much.	1
dia120_utt5.wav	Well, I like that idea.	2
dia120_utt6.wav	Obviously!	2
dia120_utt7.wav	I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow?	1
dia120_utt8.wav	I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like	1
dia120_utt9.wav	No.	0
dia120_utt10.wav	"Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely."""	2
dia120_utt11.wav	Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.	0
dia120_utt12.wav	So, thats it?	0
dia120_utt13.wav	I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.	1
dia120_utt14.wav	Which is why	1
dia120_utt15.wav	What do you have against the beautiful guest room?	0
dia120_utt16.wav	I dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!	0

dia123_utt3.wav	Okay. Okay, but you cant fire him today.	1

dia123_utt9.wav	"Then he comes over!  ""Im so worried about you."" Uck! Be a man!"	0
dia123_utt10.wav	What? So now Im not allowed to fire him?	0
dia123_utt11.wav	You cant fire him and dump him the same day, hell kill himself.	0
dia123_utt12.wav	Okay well then, Ill fire him today and you go out with him for another week.	1
dia123_utt13.wav	Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, Ill kill	0
dia123_utt14.wav	Okay well, then well both do it today and hell just have to deal with it!	1
dia123_utt15.wav	Okay. But the question is whos gonna go first. Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.	0
dia124_utt0.wav	This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.	1
dia124_utt1.wav	Well, I-I guess I gotta go.	0
dia124_utt2.wav	Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Ill wait for you. Do you even know how long youre going to be gone?	0

dia141_utt3.wav	Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sisters beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way.	1
dia141_utt4.wav	Although, I should probably tell you, shes a porn star.	1
dia142_utt0.wav	Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think youre chances are pretty good.	1
dia142_utt1.wav	All right.	1
dia143_utt0.wav	As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Im going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.	1
dia143_utt1.wav	Why dont you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnt have to apologize.	1
dia143_utt2.wav	I would really love it if I could do both.	1
dia143_utt3.wav	All right, II have to ask.	0
dia143_utt4.wav	What?	1
dia143_utt5.wav	Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?	0
dia143_utt6.wav	What?!	0
dia143_utt7.wav	Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?	0

dia145_utt5.wav	What's up?	1
dia145_utt6.wav	Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk.	1
dia145_utt7.wav	Man to uh, me.	1
dia145_utt8.wav	Sure. Okay.	1
dia145_utt9.wav	Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!	2
dia145_utt10.wav	Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.	1
dia145_utt11.wav	You mean scared.	1
dia145_utt12.wav	No, I mean happy.	1
dia146_utt0.wav	Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.	2

dia146_utt2.wav	What do you mean, theyre not moving in? They-theyre still moving in right?	0
dia146_utt3.wav	No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.	1
dia146_utt4.wav	What?! Over a stupid room!	0
dia146_utt5.wav	Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but Im also really psyched cause I dont have to move in here!	2
dia146_utt6.wav	Oh no, yeah no, that parts great!	2
dia147_utt0.wav	Shut-out!!	0
dia147_utt1.wav	Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!	0

dia150_utt5.wav	Rachel has those in burgendy.	1
dia151_utt0.wav	Oh, ew!	0
dia151_utt1.wav	What?	1
dia151_utt2.wav	Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you.	1
dia151_utt3.wav	Um, can you roll your tongue?	1
dia152_utt0.wav	Because I can, and my Mom couldnt, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.	1
dia152_utt1.wav	What, wait, you mean like this?	1
dia152_utt2.wav	Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.	2
dia152_utt3.wav	Your not doing it.	1
dia152_utt4.wav	Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I cant. We dont have that....	1
dia153_utt0.wav	Where there is no fear of commitment.	1
dia153_utt1.wav	Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?	1
dia153_utt2.wav	Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.	1
dia153_utt3.wav	But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.	1
dia153_utt4.wav	It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!	0
dia153_utt5.wav	If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.	1
dia153_utt6.wav	Right.	1
dia153_utt7.wav	In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.	1
dia153_utt8.wav	Amazingly, that makes sense.	2
dia153_utt9.wav	You think?	1
dia153_utt10.wav	Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!	2
dia153_utt11.wav	Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.	0
dia154_utt0.wav	Hey!  Hey!	2
dia154_utt1.wav	Hi!	2
dia154_utt2.wav	Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.	2
dia154_utt3.wav	Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?	2

dia154_utt13.wav	Yknow, every year I say Im gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it.	1
dia154_utt14.wav	Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?	1

dia154_utt19.wav	Uh sure, sure.	1
dia154_utt20.wav	Bye guys.	1
dia155_utt0.wav	I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.	0
dia155_utt1.wav	You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like youve got a girlfriend?	0
dia155_utt2.wav	Is this about Mark?	1
dia155_utt3.wav	Oh my God.	0
dia155_utt4.wav	Okay, its not, its not.	1

dia156_utt0.wav	Bing! Were all set for tonight, 8 oclock.	2
dia156_utt1.wav	Oh uh, as it turns out, we cant do it. Monica has to work.	2
dia156_utt2.wav	Oh, my ex-wife didnt work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.	1
dia156_utt3.wav	Oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either.	1
dia156_utt4.wav	Oh? Why not?	1
dia156_utt5.wav	Its the semi-finalsof herbotchy ball tournament.	1
dia156_utt6.wav	Whats going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?	0
dia156_utt7.wav	Well now-now youre just talking crazy.	2
dia156_utt8.wav	So why cant the three of us go out together?	1
dia156_utt9.wav	Because uhwe-wewe split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.	0
dia156_utt10.wav	Good God Bing Iwell I cant say Im altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.	0
dia156_utt11.wav	And the way she looked at me, pure lust.	2
dia156_utt12.wav	Yknow what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?	0
dia156_utt13.wav	Bing my boy, were gonna get you over this.	1
dia156_utt14.wav	Now heres the plan, grab your coat, were going to a strip club.	2
dia156_utt15.wav	Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.	0
dia157_utt0.wav	Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.	1
dia157_utt1.wav	It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.	1
dia157_utt2.wav	: Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!	0
dia157_utt3.wav	It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.	1
dia157_utt4.wav	What are you doing?	1
dia157_utt5.wav	Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy.	1
dia157_utt6.wav	Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom.	1
dia157_utt7.wav	There you go sweetie...     This isn't over.	1
dia158_utt0.wav	Did he call?	1
dia158_utt1.wav	No. Sorry.	0
dia158_utt2.wav	Why?! Why?! He said hed call. Why hasnt he called?	0
dia158_utt3.wav	Maybe hes intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.	1
dia158_utt4.wav	Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasnt he called, Rachel? Why?	0
dia158_utt5.wav	Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.	1
dia158_utt6.wav	Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?	0
dia159_utt0.wav	The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt tell him not to call me, did you?	0
dia159_utt1.wav	Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.	0
dia160_utt0.wav	And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?	0
dia160_utt1.wav	I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion!	0
dia160_utt2.wav	Is that too much to ask after six years?!	0
dia160_utt3.wav	I mean what?	0

dia160_utt9.wav	I did not cry my eyes out!!	0
dia160_utt10.wav	Come on!	0
dia160_utt11.wav	Its like the end of an era!	0
dia160_utt12.wav	No more J-man and Channies!	0
dia160_utt13.wav	Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!	0
dia161_utt0.wav	Do I know why were rushing?	1
dia161_utt1.wav	Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?	1
dia161_utt2.wav	Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me.	1
dia161_utt3.wav	Oh, I found it!	2
dia161_utt4.wav	Thats so great for you guys!	2
dia161_utt5.wav	Good luck, with your girlfriend.	1
dia161_utt6.wav	Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!!	2

dia161_utt11.wav	Ahhhh!!	2
dia162_utt0.wav	Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!	2
dia162_utt1.wav	Do	1
dia162_utt2.wav	Ah,	1
dia162_utt3.wav	Do	1
dia162_utt4.wav	Ah,	1
dia162_utt5.wav	DO YOU?	0
dia163_utt0.wav	Yknow I dont understand why they didnt cry. It was a beautiful speech.	0
dia163_utt1.wav	Oh, come on.	0
dia163_utt2.wav	Hey!	0
dia163_utt3.wav	All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad!	2
dia163_utt4.wav	And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.	1
dia163_utt5.wav	And what you said about Nana.	1
dia163_utt6.wav	Ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there.	0
dia163_utt7.wav	And you know what?	1
dia163_utt8.wav	I think she was.	1
dia163_utt9.wav	Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?	0
dia164_utt0.wav	You forget how many great songs Heart had.	1
dia164_utt1.wav	Yeah.	1
dia164_utt2.wav	You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.	1
dia164_utt3.wav	So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.	1
dia164_utt4.wav	Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but Im not even sure I got it.	1
dia164_utt5.wav	What, you didnt get it? The doctor is a monkey.	1
dia164_utt6.wav	And monkeys cant write out prescriptions.	1
dia164_utt7.wav	You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.	0
dia164_utt8.wav	Your joke? Well, I think the Hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.	1
dia165_utt0.wav	I cant find garbage bags!	0
dia165_utt1.wav	Oh, I think I saw some in here.	1
dia165_utt2.wav	What is it?!	0

dia195_utt2.wav	So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.	0
dia195_utt3.wav	It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?	1
dia195_utt4.wav	Do you want me to be afraid of you?	1
dia195_utt5.wav	Of course not.	1
dia195_utt6.wav	I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it.	2
dia195_utt7.wav	I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.	2
dia195_utt8.wav	Really?	2
dia195_utt9.wav	Of course!	1
dia195_utt10.wav	Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.	2
dia195_utt11.wav	All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit	1
dia196_utt0.wav	Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is	0
dia196_utt1.wav	A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!	0
dia196_utt2.wav	Ooh, it's not a toy.	0
dia196_utt3.wav	Well, I don't know what else to do.	0
dia196_utt4.wav	I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30!	0
dia196_utt5.wav	So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it!	0
dia196_utt6.wav	'Cause I-I got nothing!	0
dia196_utt7.wav	All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.	0
dia196_utt8.wav	Okay then.	1
dia196_utt9.wav	Here we go.	1
dia196_utt10.wav	Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?	1
dia196_utt11.wav	Ask again later.	1
dia196_utt12.wav	Later is not good enough.	0
dia196_utt13.wav	Ask again later.	1
dia196_utt14.wav	What the hell!	0
dia196_utt15.wav	This is broken!	0
dia196_utt16.wav	It-it is broken!	0
dia196_utt17.wav	All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.	1
dia197_utt0.wav	Excuse me.	1
dia197_utt1.wav	Yeah?	1
dia197_utt2.wav	Are you Phoebe Buffay?	1
dia197_utt3.wav	Yeah.	1
dia197_utt4.wav	Can-can I get your autograph, Im your biggest fan.	2
dia198_utt0.wav	I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...	1
dia198_utt1.wav	Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.	2
dia198_utt2.wav	No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.	0
dia198_utt3.wav	Come on, two on one.	1
dia198_utt4.wav	What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!	0
dia198_utt5.wav	What, now?	0
dia198_utt6.wav	Yes, now is when you swoop!	2
dia198_utt7.wav	You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not!	2
dia198_utt8.wav	You're like, like the anti-Paolo!	0
dia198_utt9.wav	My Catholic friend is right.	1
dia198_utt10.wav	She's distraught.	1
dia198_utt11.wav	You're there for her.	1
dia198_utt12.wav	You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!	2
dia199_utt0.wav	Well, I just called Joshua	1
dia199_utt1.wav	Oh, how did it go?	0
dia199_utt2.wav	Well, I did my best to convince him that Im not some crazy girl who is dying to get marriedIm just going through a hard time.	1
dia199_utt3.wav	What did he say?	1
dia199_utt4.wav	Well uh, his answering machine was	0
dia199_utt5.wav	Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that hes gonna call you again.	0
dia199_utt6.wav	Yeah, maybe, but I dont think I even care.	0
dia199_utt7.wav	I dont think hes the one Im sad about.	0
dia199_utt8.wav	Yknow, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I dont think Im handling it all that well.	0
dia199_utt9.wav	Yeah, maybe.	0
dia199_utt10.wav	And I-I am just trying to figure out why.	0
dia199_utt11.wav	Any luck?	0
dia199_utt12.wav	Well, yeah, yknow how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?	0
dia199_utt13.wav	I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.	0
dia199_utt14.wav	Again. Yknow what? I think we all did.	0
dia199_utt15.wav	Hey!	2
dia200_utt0.wav	I dont get it!	0
dia200_utt1.wav	It was in my room all night!	0
dia200_utt2.wav	And if she didnt take it, and I didnt take it; and you  didnt take it, then who did?	0
dia200_utt3.wav	Shh!	0
dia200_utt4.wav	Were trying to think!	0
dia201_utt0.wav	This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.	1
dia201_utt1.wav	What?!	0
dia201_utt2.wav	Oh yeah!	2
dia201_utt3.wav	I got in there myself once.	1
dia201_utt4.wav	My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldnt, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.	1
dia201_utt5.wav	Yeah.	1
dia201_utt6.wav	It was funny til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.	1
dia201_utt7.wav	No, you, you cant fit in that thing. Thats not deep enough.	1
dia201_utt8.wav	Oh yeah?  If I cant, Ill knock five bucks off the price off the unit.	0
dia201_utt9.wav	All right, you have yourself a deal.	1
dia201_utt10.wav	Okay.  See?! I told ya!	2
dia201_utt11.wav	Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!	0
dia202_utt0.wav	Hey! Whats up?	1
dia202_utt1.wav	Hey!	2
dia202_utt2.wav	Hey-hey, whos your friend?  Hey!!	2

dia202_utt7.wav	Ohh, listen. Ive got to get going. Today was great, thanks!	2
dia203_utt0.wav	I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.	0
dia203_utt1.wav	Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just	1
dia203_utt2.wav	Really?!	2
dia203_utt3.wav	Ohh!	2
dia203_utt4.wav	Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.	1
dia203_utt5.wav	Really?!	2
dia203_utt6.wav	Yeah!	2
dia203_utt7.wav	I mean you definitely should do that.	1
dia203_utt8.wav	Y'know what, I should do it.	2
dia203_utt9.wav	Yeah!	2
dia203_utt10.wav	Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.	2

dia203_utt12.wav	All right.	1
dia204_utt0.wav	Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.	0
dia204_utt1.wav	This woman's living my life.	0
dia204_utt2.wav	What?	0
dia204_utt3.wav	She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!	0
dia204_utt4.wav	Look at this, look.	0
dia204_utt5.wav	She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see.	0
dia204_utt6.wav	She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people.	0
dia204_utt7.wav	She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.	0
dia204_utt8.wav	You're not an artist.	1
dia204_utt9.wav	Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.	0
dia205_utt0.wav	I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.	0
dia205_utt1.wav	No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.	0
dia205_utt2.wav	I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.	1
dia205_utt3.wav	Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!	0
dia205_utt4.wav	I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!	0
dia205_utt5.wav	Oh, that is so sick.	0
dia205_utt6.wav	I feel violated. And not in a good way.	0
dia205_utt7.wav	How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!	0
dia206_utt0.wav	Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?	2
dia206_utt1.wav	Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.	1
dia206_utt2.wav	I know. My arm is killing me.	1
dia206_utt3.wav	No, I meant with the dropper over here.	1
dia206_utt4.wav	Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm	0
dia207_utt0.wav	Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.	0
dia207_utt1.wav	What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.	0
dia208_utt0.wav	Hey.	1
dia208_utt1.wav	I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time. it is like a freak show up here.	1
dia208_utt2.wav	Whats the matter?	1
dia208_utt3.wav	Nothing.	1
dia208_utt4.wav	What is it? Hey!	0
dia208_utt5.wav	Really its nothing. Im just	0
dia208_utt6.wav	Rach come on, what?	1
dia208_utt7.wav	Ive just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.	0
dia208_utt8.wav	What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?	0
dia208_utt9.wav	Oh please, hell be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.	0
dia208_utt10.wav	Okay, how long was I watching that woman?	1
dia208_utt11.wav	Im just saying that yknow, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody andhes gonna have his own life. Right?	0
dia208_utt12.wav	Yeah, I guess so.	1
dia208_utt13.wav	I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?	0
dia209_utt0.wav	Bob. Bob! Bob!!!  What the hell are you doing?!	0
dia209_utt1.wav	I just found out this is Chandlers office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!	2
dia210_utt0.wav	Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.	0
dia210_utt1.wav	We said seven!	0
dia210_utt2.wav	We said six!	0
dia210_utt3.wav	The only way that I said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six.	1
dia210_utt4.wav	"Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I wouldve said something like this, ""Wow! My boyfriends such a wise assseven!"""	0
dia210_utt5.wav	Hi!	2
dia210_utt6.wav	Oh my good God.	0
dia210_utt7.wav	I know what time you said.	2
dia210_utt8.wav	What?!	0
dia210_utt9.wav	Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.	1
dia211_utt0.wav	You, get out of my shop!	0
dia211_utt1.wav	Well, what did he do?	0
dia211_utt2.wav	He went out with my wife!	0
dia211_utt3.wav	Joey!	0
dia211_utt4.wav	Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-IHey! I did	0
dia211_utt5.wav	Thats my wife!!! Get out!	0
dia211_utt6.wav	Well, we should go.	1
dia211_utt7.wav	Yeah.	1
dia212_utt0.wav	Yknow you, really didnt have to take me to the airport.	1
dia212_utt1.wav	Oh please.	1
dia212_utt2.wav	Every moment is precious.	0
dia212_utt3.wav	Yknow?	1
dia212_utt4.wav	Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving.	0
dia212_utt5.wav	Well, were really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.	1
dia212_utt6.wav	On no! No! Its not good-bye, Im not leaving until you get on that plane.	0
dia213_utt0.wav	No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him.	0
dia213_utt1.wav	Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.	1
dia213_utt2.wav	Yes, and I was saying the actual words.	1
dia213_utt3.wav	So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed.	1
dia213_utt4.wav	We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.	1
dia213_utt5.wav	Sweetie, with you its gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love.	2
dia213_utt6.wav	Yeah?	2
dia213_utt7.wav	Yeah!	2
dia213_utt8.wav	Just go for it Chandler.	1
dia213_utt9.wav	Yeah, you should.	1
dia213_utt10.wav	Yeah, you should, really.	1
dia213_utt11.wav	All right, all right, Ill go sleep with my girlfriend. But Im just doing it for you guys.	1
dia214_utt0.wav	: Im sure as hell a dancer, its no use Marge will never go for me.	0
dia214_utt1.wav	Come on Treeger, dont say that.	0
dia214_utt2.wav	You just ahh, you just need more practice.	1
dia214_utt3.wav	Here, come on, lets ahh, lets try it again.	1
dia214_utt4.wav	Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.	0
dia214_utt5.wav	I mean, yknow, Im not really that comfortable dancing with a We-he!!	2
dia214_utt6.wav	Hey!	2
dia214_utt7.wav	: Yeah!	2
dia215_utt0.wav	Are you sure? Ill bet theres another flight to Minsk in like	1
dia215_utt1.wav	July. Umm,	1
dia215_utt2.wav	Thats really beautiful. What does it mean?	2
dia215_utt3.wav	Please, clean my beakers. I dont get out of the lab much.	1
dia215_utt4.wav	Thats good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.	2
dia215_utt5.wav	Yeah, I Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldnt because yknow, Ihave to leave.	1
dia215_utt6.wav	Youre right! Youre right. Dont say it.	0
dia215_utt7.wav	I-I do though.	0
dia215_utt8.wav	I do too.	0
dia215_utt9.wav	Bye Phoebe.	1
dia215_utt10.wav	Okay, nows not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.	0
dia216_utt0.wav	Yeah, I-I heard.  I think its great!  Ohh, Im so happy for you!	2
dia216_utt1.wav	I cant believe youre getting married!	2
dia216_utt2.wav	Yeah.	1
dia216_utt3.wav	Monica and Rachel made out.	1
dia217_utt0.wav	Ohhh!	0
dia217_utt1.wav	Why are we in bed together?	0
dia217_utt2.wav	I dont know. Do-do you have any clothes on?	1
dia217_utt3.wav	Yeah.	1
dia217_utt4.wav	Really?!	0
dia217_utt5.wav	No!	1
dia217_utt6.wav	But we-we didnt havesex-uh, did we?	0
dia217_utt7.wav	I mean, I dont remember much about last night, it was such a blur.	1
dia217_utt8.wav	Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.	2
dia217_utt9.wav	And we didnt have sex.	1
dia217_utt10.wav	Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. Im just glad we didnt do anything stupid.	1
dia217_utt11.wav	Tell me about it.	1
dia218_utt0.wav	What are we gonna do?	1
dia218_utt1.wav	I say we go with	1
dia218_utt2.wav	Chandler?	1
dia219_utt0.wav	Did she see us yet? Did she see us?	1
dia219_utt1.wav	Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?	0
dia220_utt1.wav	I know!	0
dia221_utt0.wav	Hi, remember us?	1
dia221_utt1.wav	Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a	1
dia221_utt2.wav	I am. I'm	1
dia221_utt3.wav	Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.	1
dia221_utt4.wav	Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.	0
dia222_utt0.wav	Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.	1
dia222_utt1.wav	Yknow what? It	1
dia222_utt2.wav	Sorry.	1
dia222_utt3.wav	Im so exited!	2
dia222_utt4.wav	Ive been waiting for this for months!	2
dia222_utt5.wav	I got my hair coloured!	2
dia222_utt6.wav	I got new sheets!	2
dia222_utt7.wav	Im making him a	2
dia222_utt8.wav	What am I making him by the way?	1
dia222_utt9.wav	Well, youre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.	1
dia222_utt10.wav	I thought I was making him filet mignon?	0
dia222_utt11.wav	Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.	1
dia222_utt12.wav	And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.	0
dia222_utt13.wav	Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.	2
dia223_utt0.wav	Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it!	0
dia223_utt1.wav	Im not worried, Im uh, Im fascinated.	0
dia223_utt2.wav	Yknow its like uh, Biology!	1
dia223_utt3.wav	Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.	0
dia223_utt4.wav	Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.	1
dia223_utt5.wav	Phoebe!	2
dia223_utt6.wav	If you wouldve let me finish, it goes on to say that hes probably not gay.	1
dia224_utt0.wav	You are falling fast asleep.	1
dia224_utt1.wav	Deeper.	1
dia224_utt2.wav	Deeper.	1
dia224_utt3.wav	Deeper.	1
dia224_utt4.wav	You are now completely asleep.	1
dia224_utt5.wav	You dont need to smoke.	1
dia224_utt6.wav	Cigarettes dont control you.	1
dia224_utt7.wav	You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.	1
dia224_utt8.wav	A strong, confident woman.	1
dia225_utt0.wav	Thank you for your patience, youre the next caller.	1
dia225_utt1.wav	Yes!! Yes!! Im the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.	2
dia225_utt2.wav	Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?	1
dia225_utt3.wav	Of course not.	0
dia225_utt4.wav	No.	1
dia225_utt5.wav	Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.	1
dia226_utt0.wav	So how are things going with Paul?	1
dia226_utt1.wav	Good.	2
dia226_utt2.wav	Although yknow, he-hes a private guy.	1
dia226_utt3.wav	Yknow, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.	0
dia226_utt4.wav	Thats easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that wont open.	1
dia226_utt5.wav	So what are you saying.  I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?	0
dia226_utt6.wav	No thats what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.	1
dia226_utt7.wav	Hi honey.	1
dia226_utt8.wav	Hi!	2
dia227_utt0.wav	Okay, Ben, I wont tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you dont tell about our little bonking incident.	0
dia227_utt1.wav	Monica, number one, I dont think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?!	0
dia227_utt2.wav	You said number two.	1
dia227_utt3.wav	I also said number one.	1
dia228_utt0.wav	Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.	1
dia228_utt1.wav	Cant I just look at the handles on them?	1
dia228_utt2.wav	You would think.	1
dia228_utt3.wav	Okay, fine.	1
dia228_utt4.wav	Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why Im a terrible waitress?	0
dia228_utt5.wav	Because, I dont care.	1
dia228_utt6.wav	I dont care.	1
dia228_utt7.wav	I dont care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I dont care where the tray spot is, I just dont care, this is not what I want to do.	0
dia228_utt8.wav	So I dont think I should do it anymore.	0
dia228_utt9.wav	Im gonna give you my weeks notice.	0
dia228_utt10.wav	What?!	0
dia228_utt11.wav	Gunther, I quit.	0
dia228_utt12.wav	Does this mean were gonna have to start paying for coffee?	0
dia229_utt0.wav	Ohh, I mean its just so realistic!	2
dia229_utt1.wav	I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.	1
dia229_utt2.wav	Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!	2
dia229_utt3.wav	Do you uh, do youready for a refill?	1
dia229_utt4.wav	Oh, I probably shouldntso I will!  Oh! Wow! Its like its raining!	2
dia229_utt5.wav	Pretty cool, huh?	2
dia229_utt6.wav	But if youre thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldnt get sucked up into the mechanism, well youd be wrong.	1

dia268_utt4.wav	Hi.	1
dia268_utt5.wav	Hi.	1
dia268_utt6.wav	I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.	1
dia268_utt7.wav	Ok.	1
dia268_utt8.wav	Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know!	1
dia268_utt9.wav	So, keep having sex on a regular basis.	1
dia268_utt10.wav	Oh, DAMN IT!	0
dia268_utt11.wav	Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.	1
dia268_utt12.wav	Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.	1
dia268_utt13.wav	Ok.	1
dia269_utt0.wav	Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-	1

dia270_utt5.wav	What's it look like?	1
dia270_utt6.wav	Kinda like a big face without skin.	1
dia270_utt7.wav	Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.	1
dia270_utt8.wav	Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.	2
dia270_utt9.wav	Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.	1
dia270_utt10.wav	Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.	2
dia270_utt11.wav	Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.	1
dia270_utt12.wav	The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?	2

dia271_utt5.wav	Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.	1
dia272_utt0.wav	and that was all before 10 oclock.	1
dia272_utt1.wav	The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.	1
dia272_utt2.wav	And then the florist phoned to say there arent any tulips.	1
dia272_utt3.wav	Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.	1
dia272_utt4.wav	Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily,  honey, okay?	0

dia278_utt11.wav	I know, but look at me: all tan.	2
dia278_utt12.wav	Hey, why dont you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.	1
dia278_utt13.wav	Thats a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Yknow	2
dia278_utt14.wav	Yeah thats great! Next to that, Chandler wont look so stupid.	1
dia278_utt15.wav	Chandler what do you say?	1

dia279_utt8.wav	Well	1
dia279_utt9.wav	Why don’t you phase it out?	1
dia279_utt10.wav	Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.	0
dia279_utt11.wav	Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!	1
dia279_utt12.wav	They’re not listening too me?	0
dia279_utt13.wav	Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.	1
dia279_utt14.wav	Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?	1
