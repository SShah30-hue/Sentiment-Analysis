dia63_utt0.wav	Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!	2
dia63_utt1.wav	A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?	1
dia63_utt2.wav	No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batmans tux!	2
dia63_utt3.wav	What?	0
dia63_utt4.wav	Thats right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit filmthat Batman film he was in.	2

dia63_utt6.wav	So?	1
dia63_utt7.wav	SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special.	0

dia64_utt6.wav	Phoebe, were getting	1

dia64_utt9.wav	What?! No! It was my idea!	0
dia64_utt10.wav	Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.	1

dia66_utt5.wav	What?!?!	0
dia66_utt6.wav	Okay, this is what Im talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.	1
dia66_utt7.wav	You can spill. In the sink.	1
dia66_utt8.wav	Aw, honey its not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I dont see that happening.	0
dia66_utt9.wav	I love you, too.	2
dia66_utt10.wav	Aww, good.  What?	2
dia66_utt11.wav	What? Im just said.	0

dia67_utt3.wav	Well, Im-Im just glad I could, yknow, help you out.	1
dia67_utt5.wav	Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me!	2
dia67_utt6.wav	I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless.	0
dia67_utt7.wav	You just saved me!	2
dia67_utt8.wav	Youre my hero!	2
dia67_utt9.wav	Hero, I uh, I dont knowwell, all right.	1
dia67_utt10.wav	Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!	2
dia67_utt11.wav	Oh please!   Youre gonna say things now, arent ya?	2
dia67_utt12.wav	No.	1
dia67_utt13.wav	No, I wont.	1
dia67_utt14.wav	But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise.	1
dia67_utt15.wav	She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnt love her, but he really did, and it just blew up!	0
dia68_utt0.wav	...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready?	0
dia68_utt1.wav	Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.	2

dia70_utt0.wav	Wow! Thats ah, thats pretty nice!	2
dia70_utt1.wav	Pretty nice?	1
dia70_utt2.wav	Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.	1
dia70_utt3.wav	We dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? Weve got a canoe.	1
dia70_utt4.wav	Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe.	1
dia70_utt5.wav	You gotta take the canoe!	0
dia70_utt6.wav	All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!	1
dia70_utt7.wav	Were not throwing it away! I built that canoe!	0
dia70_utt8.wav	Good for you!!	0

dia72_utt6.wav	No.	1
dia72_utt7.wav	All right, yknow what, shes  gonna think that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is hand you a library card.	1

dia82_utt0.wav	Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad.	1

dia113_utt1.wav	Do you always have to bring him here?	0

dia113_utt3.wav	Alright?	1
dia113_utt4.wav	We- we had our first fight this morning.	1
dia113_utt5.wav	I think it has to do with my working late.	1
dia113_utt6.wav	I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...	1
dia113_utt7.wav	Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.	1
dia113_utt8.wav	Oh, that'd be great!	2
dia113_utt9.wav	Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.	1
dia113_utt10.wav	Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.	1
dia114_utt0.wav	Check this out.	1
dia114_utt1.wav	It says here that theres a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!	2
dia114_utt2.wav	"""Its almost as good as being there."""	1

dia116_utt4.wav	Yeah.	1
dia116_utt5.wav	My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.	1
dia116_utt6.wav	I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.	1
dia116_utt7.wav	No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says hes gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.	0

dia119_utt4.wav	Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.	0

dia202_utt8.wav	I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!	2
dia202_utt9.wav	But my apartment!	0
dia202_utt12.wav	Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.	1
dia202_utt13.wav	Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out.	1
dia202_utt14.wav	Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies!	1

dia207_utt3.wav	Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi.	1
dia207_utt4.wav	Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.	1
dia207_utt5.wav	You didnt say Boutros Boutros Gali.	1
dia207_utt6.wav	Boutros Boutros Gali.	1
dia207_utt7.wav	He says he was too.	1
dia207_utt8.wav	Interesting.	1

dia207_utt12.wav	So you're a chef?	1

dia207_utt18.wav	What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?	0
dia207_utt19.wav	That would be great. Thank you.	1

dia208_utt2.wav	When did that happen to you?!	0

dia211_utt0.wav	So Chandler, your parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.	2
dia211_utt1.wav	Oh yeah, I should probably call them.	1
dia211_utt2.wav	I remember when we first got engaged.	2
dia211_utt3.wav	Oh, I dont think I ever heard that story.	1
dia211_utt5.wav	Well, Id gotten Judy pregnant. I still dont know how that happened.	2
dia211_utt6.wav	You dont know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!	0
dia211_utt7.wav	What a sweet story.	1

dia212_utt5.wav	No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.	0
dia212_utt6.wav	Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont seem to think its that bad.	1
dia212_utt7.wav	Thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.	0
dia212_utt8.wav	But hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest.	1
dia212_utt9.wav	Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!	0

dia236_utt9.wav	Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?	1
dia236_utt10.wav	Theyre all tourists.	1
dia236_utt11.wav	All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.	0
dia236_utt12.wav	Oh yeah?  If youre gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.	1

dia237_utt1.wav	What?	0
dia237_utt2.wav	Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.	0
dia237_utt3.wav	And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my	1
dia237_utt4.wav	Whoa, whoa, whoa.	0
dia237_utt5.wav	You don't even know me...	0
dia237_utt6.wav	Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.	0

dia238_utt1.wav	Okay, heres what were gonna do.	1
dia238_utt2.wav	Okay, Im gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral.	1
dia238_utt3.wav	You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot.	1
dia238_utt4.wav	Okay?	1
dia238_utt5.wav	All right, here we go.	1
dia238_utt6.wav	Haul ass!!!	1
dia239_utt0.wav	So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain.	1
dia239_utt1.wav	So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...	1
dia239_utt2.wav	...and live forever as a machine!	2
dia239_utt3.wav	That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?	2
dia239_utt4.wav	You and I, we're interfacing.	1
dia239_utt5.wav	Yeah, I gotta go.	0
dia239_utt6.wav	Ba dum bumb cheshhh!	2
dia240_utt0.wav	David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.	1
dia240_utt1.wav	Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.	1
dia240_utt2.wav	See?	1
dia240_utt3.wav	"Yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind""."	0
dia240_utt4.wav	Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.	1
dia240_utt5.wav	Oh, I should go, too.	1
dia240_utt6.wav	Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.	1
dia241_utt0.wav	Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there.	0
dia241_utt1.wav	"And she was like ""Oh, don't worry!"	0
dia241_utt2.wav	I asked him.	1
dia241_utt3.wav	"He's totally ok with seeing you!""."	0
dia241_utt4.wav	So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!	2
dia241_utt5.wav	Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!	0
dia241_utt6.wav	Exactly!	1
dia241_utt7.wav	And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!	1
dia241_utt8.wav	I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,	0
dia241_utt9.wav	Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.	1
dia241_utt10.wav	Ok, that'll be great!	2
dia241_utt11.wav	Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.	0
dia241_utt12.wav	That's not what we're gonna do!	0
dia241_utt13.wav	Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?	0
dia242_utt0.wav	Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.	2
dia242_utt1.wav	Hello Skidmark.	1
dia242_utt2.wav	Its a nickname, Ill explain later.	1
dia242_utt3.wav	Its pretty clear.	1
dia242_utt4.wav	Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.	1
dia242_utt5.wav	Thats why you broke up with me?	0
dia242_utt6.wav	You-you-you didnt know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!	0
dia243_utt0.wav	Ni-chou chi-ma!	2
dia243_utt1.wav	Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....	2
dia244_utt0.wav	Hi everyone.	1
dia244_utt1.wav	I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.	1
dia244_utt3.wav	Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.	1
dia244_utt4.wav	What did, what did he say?	0
dia244_utt5.wav	Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know.	1
dia244_utt6.wav	So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so.	1
dia245_utt0.wav	Oh, great!	2
dia245_utt1.wav	We couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.	2
dia245_utt2.wav	Okay, stop it Phoebe, youre getting me all tingly.	2
dia245_utt3.wav	"All I could think of was yknow, ""Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"""	2
dia245_utt4.wav	And did he?	1
dia245_utt5.wav	Im a lady Monica, I dont kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.	2
dia245_utt6.wav	Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.	1
dia245_utt7.wav	I just like him so much that I just feel like Ive had 10 drinks today and Ive only had six.	2
dia245_utt8.wav	Oh, I havent had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler.	2
dia245_utt9.wav	Wow, Im never gonna have that feeling again, am I?	0
dia245_utt10.wav	You sound like a guy.	0
dia245_utt11.wav	"No, a guy would be saying, ""Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."""	0
dia245_utt12.wav	Oh my God!	0
dia245_utt13.wav	Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!	0
dia245_utt14.wav	Ive been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that Id be giving up!	0
dia245_utt15.wav	I mean, IIm never gonna have a first kiss again.	0
dia245_utt16.wav	Youll have a last kiss.	1
dia246_utt0.wav	Thank you so much for coming back over.	2
dia246_utt1.wav	Oh good, youre here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.	0
dia246_utt2.wav	I know Mona, just hear me out.	1
dia246_utt3.wav	First of all, Im so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own.	1
dia246_utt4.wav	Youre gonna have to tell me how you did that.	1
dia246_utt5.wav	Focus.	1
dia246_utt6.wav	Okay. UmButOkay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are	1
dia247_utt0.wav	All right wheres that turkey!	1
dia247_utt1.wav	Joey! Those are my maternity pants!	0
dia247_utt2.wav	Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!	2
dia248_utt0.wav	No.	1
dia248_utt1.wav	No!	0
dia248_utt3.wav	Oh, would you look at that Monica?	2
dia248_utt4.wav	I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.	2
dia248_utt5.wav	Okay, Im next.  Dont! Dont start another game! I said Im next! Phoebe!	0
dia248_utt6.wav	Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning.	2
dia248_utt7.wav	Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game!	0
dia249_utt0.wav	Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?	1
dia249_utt1.wav	Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.	1
dia249_utt2.wav	Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work.	1
dia249_utt3.wav	But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!	2
dia249_utt4.wav	I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!	0
dia249_utt5.wav	Or Friday with no two pizzas!	0
dia249_utt6.wav	All right fine! If it means that much to you! But justtheres gonna be a ton left over.	0
dia249_utt7.wav	No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey!	2
dia249_utt8.wav	All right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?	1
dia249_utt9.wav	Thats right!	2
dia249_utt10.wav	Cause Im a Tribbiani!	2
dia249_utt11.wav	And this is what we do!	1
dia249_utt13.wav	We can eat!	2
dia250_utt0.wav	Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.	2
dia250_utt1.wav	Look at this!	2
dia250_utt2.wav	Oh! You have a window!	2
dia250_utt3.wav	Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...	2
dia250_utt4.wav	Oh look! That guy's peeing!	2
dia250_utt5.wav	Hi.	1
dia250_utt6.wav	Hi.	1
dia251_utt0.wav	Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?	0
dia251_utt1.wav	Okay. Lets use this brush.	1
dia251_utt2.wav	Okay. This stuff?	1
dia251_utt3.wav	Yeah.	1

dia251_utt6.wav	Okay-Dokey	0
dia252_utt0.wav	Where exactly is your zoo?	1
dia252_utt1.wav	Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience.	1
dia252_utt2.wav	Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?	1
dia252_utt3.wav	Yes.	1
dia252_utt4.wav	Does he, uh, fight with other animals?	1
dia252_utt5.wav	No-no, he's, he's very docile.	1
dia252_utt6.wav	Even if he were... cornered?	1
dia252_utt7.wav	Well I, I don't know. Why?	1
dia252_utt8.wav	Uh, how is he at handling small objects?	1
dia252_utt9.wav	He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...	1
dia252_utt10.wav	How about a hammer, or a small blade?	1
dia252_utt13.wav	Otherwise it's just cruel.	1
dia252_utt14.wav	He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.	2
dia252_utt15.wav	We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...	1
dia252_utt16.wav	...He's in.	1
dia252_utt17.wav	He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!	2
dia252_utt18.wav	You're making a big mistake here.	0
dia252_utt19.wav	I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.	1
dia253_utt0.wav	My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.	1
dia253_utt1.wav	Really helped speed the process along!	2
dia253_utt2.wav	Janice!	2
dia253_utt3.wav	You're not... gone?	2
dia253_utt4.wav	Sid is still in his room.	1
dia253_utt5.wav	I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him.	2
dia253_utt6.wav	So did you do it?	2
dia253_utt7.wav	Did you make your deposit?	1
dia253_utt8.wav	Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!	2
dia253_utt9.wav	That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?	0
dia253_utt10.wav	I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.	2
dia253_utt11.wav	Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.	1
dia254_utt0.wav	Phoebe, where's your purse?	0

dia255_utt2.wav	Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?	0
dia255_utt3.wav	Well, you never told me how old you were.	1
dia255_utt4.wav	Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?	0
dia255_utt5.wav	I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...	2
dia255_utt6.wav	Don't say it.	0
dia255_utt7.wav	...in love with you.	2

dia256_utt1.wav	Uh sweetie, maybe youd be more comfortable here?	1
dia256_utt2.wav	You. Like you havent done enough.	0
dia256_utt3.wav	Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.	1
dia256_utt4.wav	I mean I wish I were a seahorse.	1
dia256_utt5.wav	Because with seahorses its the male, they carry the babies.	1
dia256_utt6.wav	And then also umm, Id be far away in the sea.	0
dia256_utt7.wav	God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!	2
dia256_utt8.wav	Oh I know, Ive been there. I remember toward the end	1
dia256_utt9.wav	Oh Phoebe, thats a great story.	1

dia283_utt1.wav	There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! Im thinking even more than you.	1
dia283_utt2.wav	Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.	0
dia283_utt3.wav	Im just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in womens underwear!	1

dia287_utt5.wav	Pathetic mess?	1
dia287_utt6.wav	I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable.	1

dia293_utt4.wav	Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.	0
dia293_utt5.wav	No sweetie, youve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! Youve got to kiss some serious robot ass!	1
dia293_utt6.wav	Thats not a bad idea.	1
dia293_utt7.wav	Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow Im not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.	1

dia356_utt8.wav	Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?	1
dia356_utt9.wav	Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.	0
dia356_utt10.wav	Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.	0
dia356_utt11.wav	What is this? Fruit?	2
dia356_utt12.wav	Monica's making jam.	1
dia356_utt13.wav	Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?	2

dia358_utt7.wav	See that is the problem with invisible dentists.	1
dia358_utt8.wav	Why? Why cant you go to him?	2
dia358_utt9.wav	Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.	0
dia358_utt10.wav	That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienists blouse.	2
dia358_utt11.wav	Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!	0
dia358_utt12.wav	Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend Albino Bob.	1
dia358_utt13.wav	And all these people actually died?	0
dia358_utt14.wav	Yes, while I was in the chair!	0
dia358_utt15.wav	Thats why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, its not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!	1
dia358_utt16.wav	Pheebs, come on, you didnt kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.	1

dia360_utt3.wav	Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.	1
dia360_utt4.wav	Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now.	1
dia360_utt5.wav	You know, the guys are probably having a great time.	1

dia361_utt10.wav	And!! Isabella Rosselini.	2
dia361_utt11.wav	Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know shes too international, y'know shes never gonna be around.	2

dia361_utt13.wav	So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whos gonna be in the country like all the time.	1

dia450_utt8.wav	It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.	2
dia450_utt9.wav	I know its a little sudden, and its a little rushed, and its totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesnt mean I cant.	2
dia450_utt10.wav	Right?	2
dia450_utt11.wav	I mean Im-Im crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.	2

dia450_utt14.wav	Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?	1

dia450_utt16.wav	No, that was my way of telling you.	1
dia450_utt17.wav	Well, it turns out hes incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints.	1
dia450_utt18.wav	He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.	1
dia450_utt19.wav	Wow!	2
dia450_utt20.wav	Yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.	1
dia450_utt21.wav	So then, are you going to dump Jason?	1
dia450_utt22.wav	Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now sos Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?	1
dia450_utt23.wav	So Its really just about the math.	1
dia451_utt0.wav	Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.	1
dia451_utt1.wav	Ok, look! Enough is enough!	0
dia451_utt2.wav	No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!	2
dia451_utt3.wav	Monica, that was also true an	1
dia451_utt4.wav	I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!	0
dia451_utt5.wav	You knew this about me when you married me!	1

dia455_utt0.wav	So.	1
dia455_utt1.wav	So.	1
dia455_utt2.wav	I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit.	1
dia455_utt3.wav	I mean, you know, we've never really talked.	1
dia455_utt4.wav	I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?	1
dia455_utt5.wav	I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.	0
dia455_utt6.wav	Really? Me?	2
dia455_utt7.wav	Oh my god, are you kidding?	2
dia455_utt8.wav	Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.	0
dia455_utt9.wav	Well, you're not totally paranoid.	1
dia455_utt10.wav	Oy.	2
dia455_utt11.wav	Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.	0
dia455_utt12.wav	Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?	1

dia499_utt5.wav	What do you mean?	1
dia499_utt6.wav	Well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other.	1

dia529_utt3.wav	Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!	0
dia529_utt4.wav	I think I can take care of myself, Ill talk to you later.	1

dia530_utt17.wav	Oh.	0
dia530_utt18.wav	But umm, youre right.	1

dia531_utt5.wav	I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out.	0
dia531_utt6.wav	Im sorry.	0
dia531_utt7.wav	So, if we could just get back to the lecture.	1

dia531_utt10.wav	All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression.	0
dia531_utt11.wav	Obviously, I screwed up.	0
dia531_utt12.wav	But what you guys think of me is really important because Im-Im hoping to get a permanent job here.	1
dia531_utt13.wav	So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression	1
dia531_utt14.wav	Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am	0

dia532_utt4.wav	Your thoughts? Plural?	2
dia532_utt5.wav	Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,    I gotta see her!	2
dia532_utt6.wav	I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.	1
dia532_utt7.wav	Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her??	0
dia532_utt8.wav	You guys are killing me!	0
dia532_utt9.wav	She's forbidden fruit!	0
dia532_utt10.wav	It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?	0
dia532_utt11.wav	Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?	1
dia532_utt12.wav	Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.	1
dia532_utt13.wav	Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against    the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.	0
dia532_utt14.wav	Great novels?	2
dia532_utt15.wav	Fine ... mediocre porn	1
dia533_utt0.wav	Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but were gonna have to get into Mr. Zelners office.	1
dia533_utt1.wav	Now, he doesnt get in until 10, so hes no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.	1
dia533_utt2.wav	Thats kinda sad.	0
dia533_utt3.wav	Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,	1
dia533_utt4.wav	Got it!	2
dia533_utt5.wav	Lets roll!	2
dia533_utt6.wav	Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?	1

dia534_utt1.wav	Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.	1
dia534_utt2.wav	Oh! No problem! I	2

dia535_utt3.wav	I told you, were adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?	1
dia536_utt0.wav	I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!	0
dia536_utt1.wav	Look, you and I went to different high schools...	1
dia536_utt2.wav	Okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high school.	1
dia536_utt3.wav	You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket.	1
dia536_utt4.wav	I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.	0
dia536_utt5.wav	They had to have that specially made?!	0
dia536_utt6.wav	It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.	1
dia536_utt7.wav	Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!	0
dia536_utt8.wav	Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out.	2
dia536_utt9.wav	And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go.	2
dia536_utt10.wav	I-I owe her this.	1
dia536_utt11.wav	I never let her eat.	1
dia536_utt12.wav	Oh, you go out with him.	1
dia536_utt13.wav	Oh, really?!	2
dia536_utt14.wav	Yeah. Just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?	1
dia536_utt15.wav	Ill try.	1
dia537_utt0.wav	Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that youre dancing with.	1
dia537_utt1.wav	Yeah, yeah, okay.	1
dia537_utt2.wav	Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown  Im trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..	2

dia539_utt0.wav	And Joey?	1
dia539_utt1.wav	How do you think she's doing?	1

dia602_utt4.wav	Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.	2
dia602_utt5.wav	Huh. That's nice.	1
dia603_utt0.wav	and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that shouldve just lasted just one day, burned for	1
dia603_utt1.wav	Eight whole days.	1

dia604_utt5.wav	Why would you say that?	1
dia604_utt6.wav	Cause youre still into Monica.	1
dia604_utt7.wav	So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...	1
dia604_utt8.wav	Youre good. Youre good!	2

dia615_utt0.wav	Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?	1
dia615_utt1.wav	Does, um, anyone wanna see?	1
dia615_utt2.wav	Nooo..	0
dia615_utt3.wav	Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!	0
dia615_utt4.wav	It's worse than the thumb!	0
dia615_utt5.wav	Hey, this is so unfair!	0
dia615_utt6.wav	Oh, why is it unfair?	0
dia615_utt7.wav	So I have a flaw!	0
dia615_utt8.wav	Big deal!	0
dia615_utt9.wav	Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?	0
dia615_utt10.wav	And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?	0
dia615_utt11.wav	And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?	0
dia615_utt12.wav	I mean, what the hell is that thing?	0
dia615_utt13.wav	...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?	0
dia615_utt14.wav	...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?	0
dia615_utt15.wav	Well, I-I could live without it.	1
dia615_utt16.wav	Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?	1
dia615_utt17.wav	Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.	1
dia615_utt18.wav	"Oh,  ""you do, do you""?"	0
dia615_utt19.wav	You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.	1
dia615_utt20.wav	"""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work."	2
dia615_utt21.wav	Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.	1
dia615_utt22.wav	Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.	0
dia616_utt0.wav	Awww! Mel Torme died.	0
dia616_utt1.wav	Joey, that papers like a year old!	1
dia616_utt2.wav	Aw! Does that mean the	0
dia616_utt3.wav	Hey.	1
dia616_utt4.wav	Hey.	1
dia617_utt0.wav	You're sure? You're absolutely sure?	1
dia617_utt1.wav	Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.	1
dia617_utt2.wav	Probably?	1
dia617_utt3.wav	Yeah, I don't like that word.	0
dia617_utt4.wav	Kind of what probably really means.	1
dia617_utt5.wav	Yeah, uh-huh.	1
dia617_utt6.wav	"Yeah, oh, ""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" yknow?"	0
dia617_utt7.wav	"I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!"""	0
dia617_utt8.wav	You gotta take care of yourselves!	1
dia617_utt9.wav	In	1
dia617_utt10.wav	Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?	1
dia618_utt0.wav	Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.	2
dia618_utt1.wav	Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesnt he?	2
dia619_utt0.wav	Hes a keeper. How are you feeling?	1
dia619_utt1.wav	Oh, Im fine.	1
dia619_utt2.wav	Can I just say, I really admire what youre doing. Just raising her all alone.	1
dia619_utt3.wav	Oh, Im not doing it alone. I have Ross.	1
dia619_utt4.wav	Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?	1
dia619_utt5.wav	Well then he gets a divorce, its Ross!	1
dia619_utt6.wav	Im telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family.	1
dia619_utt7.wav	Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross.	0
dia619_utt8.wav	Oh well thats what I thought about my first husband, now Im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.	0
dia620_utt0.wav	And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.	1
dia621_utt0.wav	Hey. Whos that?	1
dia621_utt1.wav	New people.	1
dia621_utt2.wav	What happened to the Disgustingtons?	1
dia621_utt3.wav	Theyre having their baby!	0
dia621_utt4.wav	Its not fair Ross we got here first!	0
dia621_utt5.wav	Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.	1
dia621_utt6.wav	Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.	1
dia621_utt7.wav	Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?	2
dia622_utt0.wav	Phoebe?	1
dia622_utt1.wav	Yeah?	1
dia622_utt2.wav	Look at that guy by the window, wow!	2
dia622_utt3.wav	Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed.	1
dia622_utt4.wav	Oh, what is wrong with me lately?	0
dia622_utt5.wav	I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here.	1
dia622_utt6.wav	Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.	1
dia622_utt7.wav	Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?	1
dia622_utt8.wav	Yeah.	1
dia622_utt9.wav	This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.	1
dia622_utt10.wav	Really?! So this has happened to you?	0
dia622_utt11.wav	Oh absolutely yeah!	1
dia622_utt12.wav	Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, yknow, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.	1
dia622_utt13.wav	Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santas lap.	2
dia622_utt14.wav	Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a	1
dia623_utt0.wav	Ugh!	0
dia623_utt1.wav	I dont know what Im going to do!	0
dia623_utt2.wav	I called the company that sent and th-they dont care!	0
dia623_utt3.wav	Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isnt an emergency, then what is?	0
dia623_utt4.wav	Hey guys!	2
dia623_utt5.wav	Hey!	2
dia623_utt6.wav	Hey	1
dia623_utt7.wav	I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!	2
dia623_utt8.wav	And the guys from work had a blast.	2
dia623_utt9.wav	Yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.	2
dia623_utt10.wav	Yeah!	2
dia623_utt11.wav	And-and another one had never been to a party before, so	2
dia623_utt12.wav	So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, thats nice!	2
dia623_utt13.wav	Yeah, right!	2
dia623_utt14.wav	I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those	1
dia623_utt15.wav	That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.	0
dia623_utt16.wav	So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?	2
dia623_utt17.wav	Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.	2
dia623_utt18.wav	So you might say, its a magic ring.	2
dia624_utt0.wav	OH MY GOD!! I didnt really believe it until you just said it!!	0
dia625_utt0.wav	Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.	1
dia625_utt1.wav	Obviously! So, how do we decide?	1
dia625_utt2.wav	Well now lets-lets look at this objectively, I think I should date her	1
dia625_utt3.wav	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.	1
dia625_utt4.wav	Thats interesting, but check this out. I date her	2
dia625_utt5.wav	Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction	1
dia625_utt6.wav	Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.	1
dia625_utt7.wav	Yeah well we should order some food then.	1
dia625_utt8.wav	No Joey! Look why dont, why dont we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, well	1
dia625_utt9.wav	That sounds fair.	1
dia625_utt10.wav	Maybe Ill take her to that new French restaurant down the street	1
dia625_utt11.wav	Ah yeahwait a second now!	0
dia625_utt12.wav	Look were gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.	1
dia625_utt13.wav	I dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.	0
dia625_utt14.wav	Well sorry, thats what I do on dates.	1
dia625_utt15.wav	All right, well I guess Ill just have to do what I do on dates.	1
dia625_utt16.wav	So lets decide on the spending limit	1
dia625_utt17.wav	Yeah. Uh, a slicesix dollars?	1
dia625_utt18.wav	I was thinking more like a hundred.	1
dia625_utt19.wav	Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?	1
dia626_utt0.wav	Hi, again.	1
dia626_utt1.wav	Hey!	1
dia626_utt2.wav	Hey!	1
dia626_utt3.wav	Thank you soo, much.	2
dia626_utt4.wav	Oh, dont thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.	0
dia626_utt5.wav	You want some help with that?	1
dia626_utt6.wav	Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I dont!	1
dia626_utt7.wav	Whoa! Are you okay?	2
dia626_utt8.wav	Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.	2
dia626_utt9.wav	Its the heat.  And-and the humidity.	1
dia626_utt10.wav	Thats a uh, thats a tough combination.	1
dia626_utt11.wav	Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?	1
dia626_utt12.wav	Like you wouldnt believe.  Wow! This is a great place.	2
dia626_utt13.wav	What do you mean?	1
dia627_utt0.wav	Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.	1
dia628_utt0.wav	Oh!	2
dia628_utt1.wav	Hey, somebody left their keys.	1
dia628_utt2.wav	Ooohh, to a Porsche!	2
dia628_utt3.wav	Hey Gunther, these yours?	1

dia628_utt5.wav	Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?	1
dia628_utt6.wav	Joey, why dont you put them in the lost and found?	1
dia628_utt7.wav	Theres a lost and found?  My shoe!	0
dia628_utt8.wav	You left a shoe here?!	0
dia628_utt9.wav	Well, I didnt realize until I got home.	1
dia628_utt10.wav	I wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!	1
dia628_utt11.wav	Im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield.	1
dia628_utt12.wav	Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, Ill be sure to give him your shoe.	1
dia628_utt13.wav	Great! Thanks.	2
dia629_utt0.wav	Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.	1
dia629_utt1.wav	Carol, we've been through this before, ok?	2
dia629_utt2.wav	We have a good time.	2
dia629_utt3.wav	We laugh, we play.	2
dia629_utt4.wav	It's like we're father and son.	2
dia629_utt5.wav	Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.	2
dia629_utt6.wav	Oh, this is so cute.	2
dia629_utt7.wav	Oh, I got that for him.	1
dia629_utt8.wav	My mommies love me. That's clever.	2
dia629_utt9.wav	Hello?	1

dia629_utt15.wav	Bye.	1
dia629_utt16.wav	Did you just say Hi, Jew?	0
dia629_utt17.wav	Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.	1
dia630_utt0.wav	Now there you go! I wouldnt want my best guest to strain her eyes!	2
dia630_utt1.wav	Thanks Monica!	2
dia630_utt2.wav	Does that smell bother you?	0
dia630_utt3.wav	What the smell from Joeys? No, I can hardly smell it over here.	0
dia630_utt4.wav	Well you let me know if you can, because yknow I can bake a pie to cover it.	1
dia630_utt5.wav	I can smell it a little, bake the pie.	2
dia630_utt6.wav	Okay!	2
dia630_utt7.wav	Okay.	1
dia630_utt8.wav	Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  Its for you. Its the fire inspector.	1
dia630_utt9.wav	Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!	0
dia630_utt10.wav	Yeah, so it turns out that it wasnt the hair straightener that started the fire.	1
dia630_utt11.wav	No-no, it was the candles.	1
dia630_utt12.wav	Its very not good leaving candles unattended.	1
dia630_utt13.wav	In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is  Uhh Uhh Okay.	1
dia630_utt14.wav	Well, I have to go now.	1
dia631_utt0.wav	Joey proposed to me.	2
dia632_utt0.wav	Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!	0
dia632_utt1.wav	Well, I-I said yes.	0
dia632_utt2.wav	What?!	0
dia632_utt3.wav	Are you crazy?	0
dia632_utt4.wav	You just had Ross’s baby!	0
dia632_utt5.wav	It’s-it’s so  inappropriate.	0
dia632_utt6.wav	No, it’s worse than that.	0
dia632_utt7.wav	It’s wrong.	0
dia632_utt8.wav	It’s… It is bigger than  mine!	0
dia632_utt9.wav	I know.	1
dia632_utt10.wav	You can’t marry him!	0
dia632_utt11.wav	Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.	0
dia632_utt12.wav	Well do you love him?	1
dia632_utt13.wav	Sure.	1
dia632_utt14.wav	Sure?	1
dia632_utt15.wav	Yeah, I mean whatever.	1
dia632_utt16.wav	Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?	0
dia632_utt17.wav	No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?	0
dia633_utt0.wav	So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?	1
dia633_utt1.wav	Here comes the bride.	2

dia633_utt5.wav	Im so happy for me.	2
dia633_utt6.wav	Hello?	1
dia633_utt7.wav	Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?	0
dia633_utt8.wav	Yeah, we got him back. Everythings fine.	1
dia633_utt9.wav	Damnit!	0
dia634_utt0.wav	I will be! Listen, I dont want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?	0
dia634_utt1.wav	Fine.	1
dia634_utt2.wav	Fine, but Ill have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel.	0
dia634_utt3.wav	And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but Ill go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if thats what you want!	0
dia634_utt4.wav	No thats not what I want. Uh, Im glad you guys were bonding but I	1
dia634_utt5.wav	Look he doesnt have any brothers or sisters, somebodys gonna have to teach him this stuff!	0
dia634_utt6.wav	And I havent taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesnt know anyway!	1
dia634_utt7.wav	Crap!!	0
dia634_utt8.wav	I gotta go!	1
dia635_utt0.wav	Look at that! Look at that! Theyre going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?	0
dia635_utt1.wav	No.	1
dia635_utt2.wav	Me neither! We have to get in!	0
dia635_utt3.wav	Just act like you belong.	1
dia635_utt4.wav	Oh my God! Oranges!	2
dia635_utt5.wav	Shh!  Nice to see you again.	1
dia635_utt6.wav	Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?	1
dia635_utt7.wav	Yes, of course.	1
dia635_utt8.wav	Im sorry, would you move your thumb? I cant see the seat number.	1
dia635_utt9.wav	Oh thats all right, I have it memorized. Its 1A.	1
dia636_utt0.wav	Okay!	2
dia636_utt1.wav	Yknow what?	1
dia636_utt2.wav	I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.	2
dia636_utt3.wav	All I really needed was a plan.	1
dia636_utt4.wav	See I wanna have three kids	1
dia636_utt5.wav	Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.	2
dia636_utt6.wav	As I was saying I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time Im 35 which gives me five years.	1
dia637_utt0.wav	You spent a hundred dollars. Thats the limit. Youre screwed!	2
dia637_utt1.wav	Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,	0
dia637_utt2.wav	Oh-oh! So thats the way its gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too yknow!	0
dia637_utt3.wav	Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?	0
dia637_utt4.wav	I dont know.	1
dia637_utt5.wav	Why am I not surprised?	0
dia637_utt6.wav	Yknow what Ross? Im not gonna let you get away with this!	0
dia637_utt7.wav	I dont think you have much choice.	1
dia637_utt8.wav	Well well see!	0
dia637_utt9.wav	Bye-bye!	1
dia637_utt10.wav	Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?	1
dia637_utt11.wav	Yes. Yes. Just here  and there .	1
dia638_utt0.wav	Dad?	1
dia638_utt1.wav	Im here!	1
dia638_utt2.wav	Hey!	2
dia638_utt3.wav	Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.	2
dia638_utt4.wav	Dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house.	0
dia638_utt5.wav	Well, its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.	1
dia638_utt6.wav	Lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.	1
dia638_utt7.wav	Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.	0
dia638_utt8.wav	Oh, thats okay, I cant wait to see everything again! All of the memories	2
dia638_utt9.wav	Well, I dont know whats in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven	1
dia638_utt10.wav	I used to	1
dia638_utt11.wav	Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.	1
dia638_utt12.wav	Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a	1
dia639_utt0.wav	Ok, got the vent open.	1
dia639_utt1.wav	Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!	2
dia639_utt2.wav	Ben, you ready?	1
dia639_utt3.wav	All right, gimme your foot.	1
dia639_utt4.wav	Ok, on three, Ben.	1
dia639_utt5.wav	One, two, three.	1
dia639_utt6.wav	Ok, That's it, Ben.	1
dia639_utt7.wav	What do you see?	1
dia639_utt8.wav	Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.	1
dia639_utt9.wav	Phoebs, It's open! It's open!	2
dia639_utt10.wav	Wait! You forgot your legs!	0
dia640_utt0.wav	You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.	2
dia640_utt1.wav	Thank you.	2
dia640_utt2.wav	Filing system?	1
dia640_utt3.wav	Oh-oh!	2
dia640_utt4.wav	You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?	1
dia640_utt5.wav	It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.	2
dia640_utt6.wav	Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.	1
dia640_utt7.wav	I notice that youve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.	1
dia640_utt8.wav	Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.	2
dia640_utt9.wav	Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. Its amazing how she gets it right almost	2
dia640_utt10.wav	I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.	1
dia640_utt11.wav	Oh yes, well theres the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!	2
dia640_utt12.wav	Yes, thats very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.	1
dia640_utt13.wav	Yes, I realize that	1
dia640_utt14.wav	And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.	1
dia640_utt15.wav	I love working with designers!	2
dia640_utt16.wav	With them, under them, whats the difference? Eh, Rach?	1
dia641_utt0.wav	Chandler, you have an assistant right?	1
dia641_utt1.wav	Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!	0
dia642_utt0.wav	Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.	1
dia642_utt1.wav	I do?	2
dia642_utt2.wav	Yeah!  All right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try umm, try looking sexy.	1
dia642_utt3.wav	Okay.	1
dia642_utt4.wav	Or not.	1
dia643_utt0.wav	Where's Chandler?	1
dia643_utt1.wav	Here I am.	1
dia643_utt2.wav	Wash your hands!!!	0
dia643_utt3.wav	How did youknow?	0
dia643_utt4.wav	Hey! What's she doing back here?	0
dia643_utt5.wav	Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!	1
dia643_utt6.wav	Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...	1
dia644_utt0.wav	What happened in Atlantic City?!	2
dia644_utt1.wav	Well, Chandler and I are in a bar	1
dia644_utt2.wav	"Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!"""	0
dia644_utt3.wav	And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?	1
dia644_utt4.wav	So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.	1
dia644_utt5.wav	Now, I know what youre thinking, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and youre right, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls.	2
dia644_utt6.wav	You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.	2
dia644_utt7.wav	In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.	0
dia644_utt8.wav	Oh Mon, I laughed so hard	2
dia644_utt9.wav	Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?	0
dia644_utt10.wav	Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.	1
dia645_utt0.wav	So umm, youre gonna stay with me as long as I need you?	1
dia645_utt1.wav	Of course I am!	2
dia645_utt2.wav	Oh mom, I swear Im not an idiot.	1
dia645_utt3.wav	Ive read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didnt think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.	1
dia645_utt4.wav	And-and then guess what?	1
dia645_utt5.wav	The babys coming and I dont know what to do.	0
dia645_utt6.wav	Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?	0
dia645_utt7.wav	No. Sweetie, youre gonna be fine.	1
dia645_utt8.wav	Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?	0
dia645_utt9.wav	Im going to the bathroom.	1
dia645_utt10.wav	Okay.	1
dia645_utt11.wav	Now dont worry! Everythings gonna be okay.	1
dia645_utt12.wav	It	1
dia645_utt13.wav	Hey!	2
dia645_utt14.wav	Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?	2
dia645_utt15.wav	I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.	1
dia645_utt16.wav	Not if you were here.	1
dia646_utt0.wav	Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.	1
dia646_utt1.wav	Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope its you!	2
dia646_utt2.wav	I hope its you.	1
dia646_utt3.wav	Me too!	2
dia646_utt4.wav	First of all um, I love you both so much and youre both so important to me	2
dia646_utt5.wav	Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!	2
dia646_utt6.wav	Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.	1
dia646_utt7.wav	Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine	1
dia646_utt8.wav	Yes!!! Oh!!	2
dia646_utt9.wav	Hypothetically!	0
dia646_utt10.wav	Still.	1
dia646_utt11.wav	If Phoebe were my maid of honor	1
dia646_utt12.wav	Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.	1
dia646_utt13.wav	Yeah thats actually a pretty good idea.	1
dia646_utt14.wav	Yeah, Ill do that. So who gets to be yours?	1
dia646_utt15.wav	Well thats the best part. Umm,	1
dia646_utt16.wav	Wh-why is that the best part?	2
dia646_utt17.wav	Because then I dont have to!	2
dia646_utt18.wav	Well of	1
dia646_utt19.wav	Im really not deciding!	2
dia646_utt20.wav	Fine!	0
dia646_utt21.wav	Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!	2
dia647_utt0.wav	If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?	1
dia648_utt0.wav	It's not just the drum noise.	1
dia648_utt1.wav	"Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye!"	0
dia648_utt2.wav	"Oh god, my eye!"""	0
dia648_utt3.wav	I mean, it is so annoying.	0
dia648_utt4.wav	Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.	1
dia648_utt5.wav	Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?	0
dia648_utt6.wav	Maybe on some level.	1
dia649_utt0.wav	Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?	2
dia649_utt1.wav	No, Im picking you up for our date. These are for you.	1

dia659_utt0.wav	So, um, what do you do for a living?	1
dia659_utt1.wav	Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.	1
dia659_utt2.wav	Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.	1
dia659_utt3.wav	I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.	0
dia659_utt4.wav	Now that is funny.	1
dia659_utt5.wav	Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?	1
dia659_utt6.wav	Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.	0

dia660_utt1.wav	When I was six years old.	1
dia660_utt2.wav	Hm-mm	1
dia660_utt3.wav	I wanted a big wheel.	1
dia660_utt4.wav	And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on.	0
dia660_utt5.wav	It was embarrassing, kids made fun of me.	0
dia660_utt6.wav	That was a pretty tough year.	0

dia661_utt5.wav	You pick one.	1
dia661_utt6.wav	All right, how about the ladybugs?	1
dia661_utt7.wav	Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!	0
dia661_utt8.wav	Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!	0
dia661_utt9.wav	Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!	0

dia664_utt7.wav	Why? What happened to him?	1
dia664_utt8.wav	Nothing, hes just really believes in that.	1

dia665_utt2.wav	Well, okay, so whats nowgo get, go get the eggs, put em in there.	1

dia665_utt4.wav	"Embryossss? As in, ""More than one?"""	2
dia665_utt5.wav	Um-hmm, five actually.	1
dia665_utt6.wav	Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?	1
dia665_utt7.wav	We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.	1
dia665_utt8.wav	Thats it! 25 percent? That means thats its like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!	0
dia665_utt9.wav	Hey, yknow I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?	1
dia665_utt10.wav	Sweety, now, shes a woman, not a gumball machine.	1
dia665_utt11.wav	Okay, well yknow what, dont worry you guys, cause Im-Im gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.	1

dia665_utt13.wav	Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this.	1
dia665_utt14.wav	So, umm, were kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.	1
dia665_utt15.wav	Whoa!! Thatokay, thats a	0
dia665_utt16.wav	No, Im sorry.	1

dia793_utt3.wav	Little toast here, ding ding.	2
dia793_utt4.wav	I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.	2
dia793_utt5.wav	Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?	0
dia793_utt6.wav	So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.	2

dia840_utt10.wav	Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!	2
dia840_utt11.wav	Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies	1
dia840_utt12.wav	All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.	2
dia840_utt13.wav	Which proves that I never lie.	1

dia841_utt0.wav	Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.	0
dia841_utt1.wav	Im not freaking out.	1
dia841_utt2.wav	Why would I be freaking out?	1
dia841_utt3.wav	A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.	1
dia841_utt4.wav	Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!	0
dia841_utt5.wav	I mean, whats the harm in that?	1

dia841_utt7.wav	Chandler, please dont think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel	0
dia841_utt8.wav	Phoebe and Rachel!	0

dia841_utt10.wav	It was a mistake. Please dont take this to mean anything, because it doesnt.	0
dia841_utt11.wav	Okay.	1
dia841_utt12.wav	Really?	2
dia841_utt13.wav	Yes, if it really doesnt mean anything, because you know that Im just not ready	1

dia841_utt22.wav	I know.	1
dia842_utt0.wav	Okay look, I have an idea.	1
dia842_utt1.wav	Why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him.	1
dia842_utt2.wav	And then whoever does gets the phone.	1
dia842_utt3.wav	All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.	1
dia842_utt4.wav	Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.	0
dia842_utt5.wav	Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.	0

dia842_utt12.wav	His new girlfriend!	0
dia843_utt0.wav	I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?	0
dia843_utt1.wav	I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.	0
dia843_utt2.wav	Shes saving the rest for her divorce.	0
dia843_utt3.wav	And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to	1
dia843_utt4.wav	Well what happened at dinner?	1
dia843_utt5.wav	My parents spent the money for our wedding!	0
dia843_utt6.wav	My God! What did you order?!	0

dia843_utt10.wav	No, yknow what?	1
dia843_utt11.wav	Its gonna be okay.	1
dia843_utt12.wav	I mean you dont have to have this rustic Italian feast.	1
dia843_utt13.wav	Yknow?	1
dia843_utt14.wav	And-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.	1

dia844_utt1.wav	Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but Im having my lunch at this table, here in the middle.	1
dia844_utt2.wav	Im having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if hell sit with me.	1
dia844_utt3.wav	I will sit with you Dr. Geller.	1
dia844_utt4.wav	Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.	1
dia844_utt5.wav	Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yknow what I see, I see-I see division.	0
dia844_utt6.wav	"Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, ""My God why?!"""	0
dia844_utt7.wav	Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.	1

dia849_utt1.wav	Really? That's great!	2
dia849_utt2.wav	I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her	2
dia849_utt3.wav	(noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of	1
dia849_utt4.wav	Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks,	2
dia849_utt5.wav	Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one.	2
dia849_utt6.wav	Ben is way cuter than that kid.	2
dia849_utt7.wav	I mean look at him, look at you,	0
dia849_utt8.wav	That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?	1
dia849_utt9.wav	Joey, you look nothing like Ben.	1
dia849_utt10.wav	I look more like him than you do!	0
dia849_utt11.wav	Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.	2
dia850_utt0.wav	That really was some of your best work.	2
dia850_utt1.wav	Hm-hmm, I told you!  I cant believe that Ive only got two hours before I call in sick for work.	1
dia850_utt2.wav	I have to be up in seven minutes.	1
dia850_utt3.wav	Well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes	1

dia850_utt6.wav	Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and Ill get the furniture polish!	2

dia851_utt15.wav	Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?	1

dia852_utt4.wav	That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!	0
dia852_utt5.wav	Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.	1
dia852_utt6.wav	If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?	1
dia852_utt7.wav	Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.	0
dia852_utt8.wav	You know...  You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.	0
dia853_utt0.wav	By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.	1
dia853_utt1.wav	Oh, hello liar.	0
dia853_utt2.wav	Look, I-Im really sorry I let go of the bike.	0
dia853_utt3.wav	I couldve been killed I hope you know!	0
dia853_utt4.wav	I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were	0
dia853_utt5.wav	Well, I would love to butthe bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.	2
dia853_utt6.wav	Phoebe.	1
dia853_utt7.wav	What?!  What the hell?!	0
dia853_utt8.wav	All right, yknow what?	0
dia853_utt9.wav	If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then Im sorry, Im just gonna have to take it back.	0
dia853_utt10.wav	What?! Why?!	0
dia853_utt11.wav	Because! Because, it-it-its Itd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar	0
dia853_utt12.wav	All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.	0
dia853_utt13.wav	Great! Great!  Youre making the bike very happy.	2
dia853_utt14.wav	Okay Ross!  Please dont die!	0
dia854_utt0.wav	How could you have kept all of this from me?	0
dia854_utt1.wav	I was going to tell you, but	1
dia854_utt2.wav	But what?! You figured youd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!	0
dia854_utt3.wav	Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just  Why dont we just let the machine get that?	0
dia854_utt4.wav	Hey Ross. Its Joey. Theres a hooker over here and we thought maybe youd know something about it.	1
dia854_utt5.wav	No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-II need to, I need to lie down.	1
dia855_utt0.wav	Everything on your application looks really goodOhh!	2
dia855_utt1.wav	Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?	0
dia855_utt2.wav	Oh dont worry, Im not really a party girl.	1
dia855_utt3.wav	Whoa!! Now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?	2
dia855_utt4.wav	You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! Ill be living here.	2
dia855_utt5.wav	Oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it.	0
dia855_utt6.wav	Why did you take the shower curtain down?	0
dia855_utt7.wav	That thing was a hazard!  Im very safety conscious.	0
dia856_utt0.wav	Hi.	1
dia856_utt1.wav	Hey man, how did the audition go?	1
dia856_utt2.wav	Estelle said I didn't get it.	0
dia856_utt3.wav	What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!	0
dia856_utt4.wav	Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.	2
dia857_utt0.wav	No!	0
dia857_utt1.wav	For all I know, shes trying to find me but couldnt because I kept moving around.	1
dia857_utt2.wav	No, from now on, Im staying in one place.	1
dia857_utt3.wav	Right here.	1
dia857_utt4.wav	Well, its getting late.	1
dia857_utt5.wav	Yeah, were gonna go.	1
dia857_utt6.wav	Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?	1
dia857_utt7.wav	Ugh, yknow, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.	1
dia857_utt8.wav	Yeah, its a very large plane.	1
dia857_utt9.wav	Thats cool.	1
dia857_utt10.wav	But, well stay here with you.	1
dia857_utt11.wav	Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, yknow, but you dont have to rub my butt.	2
dia858_utt0.wav	Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.	2
dia858_utt1.wav	Theyre not a couple!	0
dia858_utt2.wav	Oh-okay, I get the game now.	1
dia858_utt3.wav	Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?	1
dia858_utt4.wav	Oh yeah!	2
dia858_utt5.wav	Well okay, so then youre fine.	1
dia858_utt6.wav	The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.	1
dia858_utt7.wav	Okay?	1
dia858_utt8.wav	So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.	1
dia858_utt9.wav	Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble.	1
dia858_utt10.wav	Really?	2
dia858_utt11.wav	Look, you guys have been to every play Ive ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?	1
dia858_utt12.wav	No.	1
dia858_utt13.wav	Noooo!!	1
dia859_utt0.wav	Ursula!  Wait! Err-err, its me! Phoebe!	2
dia859_utt1.wav	Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye.	1
dia859_utt2.wav	Wait a second! So, whats new with you?	2
dia859_utt3.wav	Umm, nothing. I mean, Im getting married next week.	1
dia860_utt0.wav	And your breasts! Hmm!!!	2
dia860_utt1.wav	Okay.	1
dia860_utt2.wav	Umm look, youre coming on a little strong.	0
dia860_utt3.wav	But Im going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together.	1
dia860_utt4.wav	So, why dont we just start over okay?	1
dia860_utt5.wav	And you can just tell me about yourself.	1
dia860_utt6.wav	All right.	1
dia860_utt7.wav	Okay.	1
dia860_utt8.wav	I write erotic novels, for children.	1
dia860_utt9.wav	What?!	0
dia860_utt10.wav	Theyre wildly unpopular.	1
dia860_utt11.wav	Oh my God!	0
dia860_utt12.wav	Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.	1
dia860_utt13.wav	Wow! You do?	2
dia860_utt14.wav	Yeah,  a Pretty Huge	2
dia860_utt15.wav	All right.	0

dia861_utt4.wav	What?	2

dia862_utt3.wav	In the hall.	1
dia863_utt0.wav	Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping.	1
dia863_utt1.wav	But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.	1
dia863_utt2.wav	Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.	1
dia863_utt3.wav	Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.	1
dia863_utt4.wav	That's a good one!	2

dia865_utt3.wav	Used to work with her. Used to! Im a relative and I didnt get invited! A	0
dia865_utt4.wav	"Stop saying, ""Blood"" to strangers."	0

dia869_utt2.wav	Look, don't you see what's happening here.	0
dia869_utt3.wav	Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.	0
dia869_utt4.wav	Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.	1
dia869_utt5.wav	What am I going to do?	0
dia869_utt6.wav	Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.	1
dia869_utt7.wav	All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.	1
dia869_utt8.wav	I don't know you guys.	0
dia869_utt9.wav	All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you.	0
dia869_utt10.wav	And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'	0
dia869_utt11.wav	And before you know it, she's with him.	0
dia869_utt12.wav	And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'	0
dia869_utt13.wav	And he'll be all, 'Yes!'	0
dia869_utt14.wav	And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'	2
dia869_utt15.wav	And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'	0
dia869_utt16.wav	And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'	0
dia869_utt17.wav	He paints quite a picture doesn't he?	1
dia870_utt0.wav	This is what Ive got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.	1

dia870_utt6.wav	Okay! Well need a six-pack of	1
dia870_utt7.wav	Hey guys, what are you doing?	1
dia871_utt0.wav	Hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youre gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.	1
dia871_utt1.wav	Oh, come on!	0
dia871_utt2.wav	Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get to know him.	1
dia871_utt3.wav	Oh well, hey, Joeys loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, hell be there.	1
dia871_utt4.wav	Well, Chandler will be there for you too.	1

dia871_utt8.wav	Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.	1
dia871_utt9.wav	But, all right, I dontmaybe Ill just name him The Hulk.	1
dia871_utt10.wav	I knew I shouldnt have mentioned it! Thats what I wanted to name my kid!	0
dia872_utt0.wav	What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.	0
dia872_utt1.wav	I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!	0
dia872_utt2.wav	Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...	2
dia872_utt3.wav	What's that supposed to mean?	2
dia872_utt4.wav	Nothing! It's an expression.	1
dia872_utt5.wav	No it's not.	1
dia872_utt6.wav	Don't listen to your mother.	1
dia872_utt7.wav	You're independent, and you always have been!	1
dia872_utt8.wav	Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!	1
dia872_utt9.wav	And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...	1
dia873_utt0.wav	PBS Telethon.	1
dia873_utt1.wav	Hi Joey.	1

dia874_utt0.wav	What kind of problem?	0
dia874_utt1.wav	Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!	0
dia874_utt2.wav	Oh my God!	0
dia874_utt3.wav	Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!	0
dia874_utt4.wav	Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.	0
dia874_utt5.wav	I don't wanna give up the bag.	0
dia874_utt6.wav	I don't have to give up the bag!	0
dia874_utt7.wav	Do I Rach?	0

dia874_utt9.wav	Honey wait, Joey, Im sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it	1
dia874_utt10.wav	I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.	0
dia874_utt11.wav	I can't believe I'm hearing this!	0
dia874_utt12.wav	Wait a minute!	0
dia874_utt13.wav	Wait a minute!	0
dia874_utt14.wav	I'm not saying that you shouldnt have a bag, I justit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial.	1
dia874_utt15.wav	Yeah umm, they're called wallets.	1
dia875_utt0.wav	I think you'll find this room more to your liking.	1
dia875_utt1.wav	Okay, great.	2
dia875_utt2.wav	They say he's only got half a tank left.	1
dia875_utt3.wav	Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!	2
dia875_utt4.wav	We're switching rooms again.	0
dia875_utt5.wav	What? Why?	0
dia875_utt6.wav	This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.	0
dia875_utt7.wav	Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.	2
dia875_utt8.wav	Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?	0
dia875_utt9.wav	Uh-huh.	1

dia877_utt3.wav	Well, Im very glad youre here.	2
dia877_utt4.wav	Oh, youre such a gentleman.  Come on! Were going to my place!	2

dia878_utt1.wav	Hey-hey.	1
dia878_utt2.wav	So are guys doing okay?	1
dia878_utt3.wav	Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.	1
dia879_utt0.wav	Do you have a minute?	1
dia879_utt1.wav	Well yeah, sure, whats up?	1
dia879_utt2.wav	I got asked out twice today when I was at lunchby guys.	1
dia880_utt0.wav	Oh really?!	2
dia880_utt1.wav	Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?	1
dia880_utt2.wav	Oh, did you not want people to know that?	2
dia881_utt0.wav	But Im not gay. And I especially wouldnt want you to think I was gay.	2
dia882_utt0.wav	Whys that?	1
dia883_utt0.wav	I dont think I should say.	1
dia883_utt1.wav	Ohh, you can say. Come on, I dont want you to feel like you cant tell me things.	1
dia883_utt2.wav	Okay.	1
dia883_utt3.wav	Kay.	1
dia883_utt4.wav	Well	1
dia883_utt5.wav	Yeah.	1
dia883_utt6.wav	Id love to ask out your friend Phoebe.	1

dia884_utt3.wav	Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?	2
dia884_utt4.wav	That would be Casey. Were going out tonight.	1
dia884_utt5.wav	Goin out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.	2
dia884_utt6.wav	No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.	1
dia884_utt7.wav	What?	0
dia884_utt8.wav	Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!	0
dia884_utt9.wav	Wait! Youre going out with Kathy!	0
dia884_utt10.wav	Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?	0
dia884_utt11.wav	Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.	0
dia884_utt12.wav	What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive.	0
dia884_utt13.wav	Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.	0
dia884_utt14.wav	But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.	1
dia884_utt15.wav	You got all that from the back of her head?	0
dia884_utt16.wav	All right look, I think its time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.	1
dia884_utt17.wav	Whos Elaine?	1
dia885_utt0.wav	Can you people not see me?!	2
dia885_utt1.wav	So, will you talk to him?	1
dia885_utt2.wav	I dont know Rach.	1
dia885_utt3.wav	Oh, come on! Ill give you ten free	0
dia885_utt4.wav	One!  No ten! You said ten! You cant take that back!	0
dia886_utt0.wav	Hey!	2
dia886_utt1.wav	Hi!	2
dia886_utt2.wav	Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television?	1
dia886_utt3.wav	We need a porn break.	1
dia886_utt4.wav	We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.	1
dia886_utt5.wav	Well, so, why dont you just turn it off?	2
dia886_utt6.wav	Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.	1
dia886_utt7.wav	Ooh, good, youre hear! Okay.	2
dia886_utt8.wav	Hey!	2
dia886_utt9.wav	Hi!	2

dia886_utt11.wav	Oh this, well Im glad you asked.	2
dia886_utt12.wav	Now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?	0
dia886_utt13.wav	Ahh!	1
dia886_utt14.wav	Now, I know what youre thinking	1
dia886_utt15.wav	Pregnant Woman Slays Four?	0
dia886_utt16.wav	Phoebe, they didnt make you pay for those knives, did they?	0
dia886_utt17.wav	No!	2
dia886_utt20.wav	Honey, youre not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.	1
dia886_utt21.wav	No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.	1
dia886_utt22.wav	Whats the second part of your plan?	1
dia887_utt0.wav	Yes thats right.	1
dia887_utt1.wav	Why?	0
dia887_utt2.wav	I tired attacking two women, did not work.	1
dia887_utt3.wav	What?!	0
dia887_utt4.wav	No, I mean its okay, I mean, theyre-theyre my friends.	1

dia887_utt13.wav	That-thats a no.	1
dia888_utt0.wav	What? No! No, Im not stopping. Im Red Ross!	0

dia888_utt2.wav	I dont care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!	0
dia888_utt3.wav	All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.	0
dia888_utt4.wav	No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.	1
dia888_utt5.wav	No. Thats not what Im saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.	1
dia888_utt6.wav	I like that.	2
dia888_utt7.wav	Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.	1
dia888_utt8.wav	Huh?	1
dia888_utt9.wav	One swift kick and hell back off.	1
dia888_utt10.wav	All right, bad ankle, got it!	1
dia888_utt11.wav	And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip.	1
dia888_utt12.wav	Yeah.	1

dia888_utt14.wav	Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!	2
dia888_utt15.wav	And uh, Liam, Liams got bad knees. You hit him right and hell go down like a lamp.	1
dia888_utt16.wav	But-but, Liams on my team.	2
dia888_utt17.wav	I dont care! You just get him!	0
dia888_utt18.wav	Im gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!	2
dia888_utt19.wav	The Red Ross! Okay.	2
dia889_utt0.wav	Oh!  Oh by the way?	1
dia889_utt1.wav	Uh-hmm.	1
dia889_utt2.wav	James Brolin?	1
dia889_utt3.wav	Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered hes gay.	1
dia889_utt4.wav	Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.	1
dia889_utt5.wav	Really?!	2
dia890_utt0.wav	Hello?	1
dia890_utt1.wav	Hello, is Ross there?	1

dia892_utt15.wav	"""Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."""	2

dia893_utt9.wav	I wont spit, and I wont stare at Monicas breasts!	0
dia893_utt10.wav	Everyone knows Im an ass man!	2
dia893_utt11.wav	That is true.	1

dia910_utt4.wav	Alan.	1
dia910_utt5.wav	He was unbelievable.	2
dia910_utt6.wav	He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...	2

dia913_utt5.wav	Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon.	1

dia913_utt7.wav	Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.	1
dia913_utt8.wav	All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?	2
dia913_utt9.wav	I'm intrigued.	1
dia913_utt10.wav	All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.	1
dia913_utt11.wav	Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.	2

dia916_utt6.wav	Its gotta be, its gotta be going somewhere right?	2
dia916_utt7.wav	So where-where is it going?	1
dia916_utt8.wav	Ah!	2
dia916_utt9.wav	Thats-thats the real question.	1

dia924_utt0.wav	Ooh, this is it!  Oh, thats him! Thats him!	2
dia924_utt1.wav	Great! Go get him.	2
dia924_utt2.wav	Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.	1
dia924_utt3.wav	Hes not really my type.	1
dia924_utt4.wav	No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see whats he like. People tell doctors everything.	1
dia924_utt5.wav	But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.	0
dia924_utt6.wav	You do attract some stinkers.	0
dia925_utt0.wav	Chandler.	1
dia925_utt1.wav	Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a	1
dia925_utt2.wav	Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.	1
dia925_utt3.wav	Oh, listen.	1
dia925_utt4.wav	If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them.	1
dia925_utt5.wav	Really.	2
dia925_utt6.wav	Nothing at all.	1
dia925_utt7.wav	Really.	2
dia925_utt8.wav	Nothing.	1
dia926_utt0.wav	Yknow when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?	1
dia926_utt1.wav	Of course! Joey wouldnt let you have one?	0
dia926_utt2.wav	No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict.	0
dia926_utt3.wav	Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youre moving out?	1
dia926_utt4.wav	No, no, I keep trying, yknow?	0
dia926_utt5.wav	"I can get out, ""Joey, I have too"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""go to the bathroom."""	0
dia926_utt6.wav	He may think Im sick.	1
dia926_utt7.wav	Yknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but I We just have to get it over with!	1
dia926_utt8.wav	Yknow, the next time we see them were just gonna tell them.	1
dia926_utt9.wav	Thats it.	1
dia926_utt10.wav	Oh, so thats this is gonna work now? Youre just gonna order me around all the time?	2
dia926_utt11.wav	Pretty much.	1
dia926_utt12.wav	All right.	1
dia926_utt13.wav	Hey Monica!	2
dia926_utt14.wav	Hi!	2
dia926_utt15.wav	Hey man, you feeling any better?	1
dia926_utt16.wav	Joey, we have something to tell you.	1
dia926_utt17.wav	Oh my God! Youre pregnant!	2
dia927_utt0.wav	Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, youre only married in Vegas.	1
dia927_utt1.wav	What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas youre married everywhere.	1
dia927_utt2.wav	Really?!	0
dia927_utt3.wav	Yeah!	1
dia927_utt4.wav	Oh my God!Eh! Well	0
dia928_utt0.wav	You see that guy? Hes in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave hes going straight to the porn.	0
dia928_utt1.wav	Hes gonna go up to the counter with	1
dia928_utt2.wav	Yeah.	1
dia928_utt3.wav	I missed this.	2
dia928_utt4.wav	Me too.	0
dia928_utt5.wav	So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?	1
dia929_utt0.wav	Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!	2
dia929_utt1.wav	Hey, its your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.	0
dia929_utt2.wav	We will.	1
dia929_utt3.wav	Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.	1
dia929_utt4.wav	No Mon,	1
dia929_utt5.wav	Every year.	1
dia930_utt0.wav	Hey! Ross!	2
dia930_utt1.wav	Die Hard	1
dia930_utt2.wav	Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?	1
dia930_utt3.wav	Whatd you rent?	1
dia930_utt4.wav	Die Hard 2	1
dia930_utt5.wav	Joey, this is	1
dia930_utt6.wav	Oh, well we watch it a second time and its	1
dia930_utt7.wav	Joey, we	1
dia930_utt8.wav	And?	1
dia930_utt9.wav	And itll be cool to see it again! Yeah!	2
dia930_utt10.wav	Die Hard	1
dia930_utt11.wav	Dude, you didnt say	1
dia930_utt12.wav	Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.	1
dia930_utt13.wav	Well, John McClane had plans!	0
dia930_utt14.wav	No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.	1
dia930_utt15.wav	What are you talking about? Bitch.	0
dia931_utt0.wav	I know you botched that operation on purpose.	2
dia931_utt1.wav	I can't prove    it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder.	0
dia931_utt2.wav	I don't care if you    are my brother.	0
dia932_utt0.wav	Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium    in the Devonian era was top notch!	2
dia932_utt1.wav	Stop going through my stuff !	0
dia932_utt2.wav	Hey!	2
dia932_utt3.wav	Hey!	2
dia932_utt4.wav	I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.	0
dia932_utt5.wav	No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.	0
dia932_utt6.wav	Please, what about you and Chandler?	0
dia932_utt7.wav	That's different! I was drunk and stupid!	0
dia932_utt8.wav	Well hello !	0
dia932_utt9.wav	What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them?	1
dia932_utt10.wav	I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!	0
dia932_utt11.wav	Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.	1
dia932_utt12.wav	I'm gonna do it.	2
dia932_utt13.wav	And I can't stop you.	1
dia932_utt14.wav	No.	1
dia932_utt15.wav	Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?	1
dia932_utt16.wav	I'm smarter than	1
dia933_utt0.wav	Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.	2
dia933_utt1.wav	Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.	2
dia933_utt2.wav	Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, cause Im heading up there.	1
dia933_utt3.wav	Uh, yeah, Ill take a coffee. Thanks, man.	1
dia933_utt4.wav	Sure.  Coffee? Cause Im going up there.	2
dia933_utt5.wav	No.	1
dia933_utt6.wav	No, thank you.	1
dia933_utt7.wav	You guys need anything, cause Im heading up there.	1
dia933_utt8.wav	Id love an ice water.	1
dia933_utt9.wav	You got it.	1
dia933_utt10.wav	Joey, what are you doing?	0
dia933_utt11.wav	Just being friendly.	0
dia933_utt12.wav	Joey, honey, I dont think youre supposed to go back there.	0
dia933_utt13.wav	Nah, its okay. Right, Gunther?	1
dia933_utt14.wav	Dont wink at me. And put on your apron.	0
dia933_utt15.wav	Okay, but I dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.	0
dia933_utt16.wav	Joey, do you work here?	0
dia933_utt17.wav	No.	1
dia933_utt18.wav	Hey, waiter.	1
dia933_utt19.wav	Yeah?	1
dia934_utt0.wav	Youve reached Monica and Chandlers, if youre listening to this message, were probably screening.  Yeah we are.	1

dia934_utt2.wav	Im calling for Monica Geller.	1
dia934_utt3.wav	I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available	1
dia934_utt4.wav	This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groomNo! Not the groom!!	0
dia935_utt0.wav	Thank you.	1
dia935_utt1.wav	Thanks.	1
dia935_utt2.wav	I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!	0
dia935_utt3.wav	Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am	1
dia935_utt4.wav	This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.	0
dia935_utt5.wav	So go fix it!	1
dia935_utt6.wav	Go find Chandler!	1
dia935_utt7.wav	He's probably up in your room!	0

dia935_utt13.wav	Hmm.	1
dia936_utt0.wav	Do you remember where the duck food is?	1
dia936_utt1.wav	Yeah, its in the guys apartment under the sink. Why?	0
dia936_utt2.wav	Because Im going to London.	1
dia936_utt3.wav	What?! What do you mean youre going to London?	0
dia936_utt4.wav	Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.	1
dia936_utt5.wav	Now honey, you take care, you dont have those babies until I get back.	1
dia936_utt6.wav	IRachel, you cant go! Ross loves Emily!	0
dia936_utt7.wav	Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does.	0
dia936_utt8.wav	But I have to tell him how I feel!	0
dia936_utt9.wav	He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.	1
dia936_utt10.wav	Thats not why youre going!	0
dia936_utt11.wav	"Youre going because you hope hes gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach."	0
dia936_utt12.wav	"Forget that British chippy."""	0
dia936_utt13.wav	OhhDo you think he will?!	2
dia936_utt14.wav	No!	0
dia936_utt15.wav	Because hes in love with the British chippy!	0
dia936_utt16.wav	Look, Rachel, if you go, youre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!	0
dia936_utt17.wav	Yknow, its too late!	0
dia936_utt18.wav	You missed youre chance!	0
dia936_utt19.wav	Im sorry, I know this must be really hard, its over.	0
dia936_utt20.wav	"Yknow what? No. Its not over until someone says, ""I do."""	0
dia936_utt21.wav	I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. Im carrying a litter.	2
dia937_utt0.wav	So is everybody here?	1
dia937_utt1.wav	I got here a little early myself.	1
dia937_utt2.wav	Let us begin.	1
dia937_utt3.wav	Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations.	1
dia937_utt4.wav	Here.	1
dia937_utt5.wav	Here.	1
dia937_utt6.wav	Now as for the hydrosaurs	1
dia938_utt0.wav	Well, so anyway Beth, what Im saying is I shouldve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night.	1
dia938_utt1.wav	Ive ah, Ive recently learned whats it like to be on your side of it, and Im sorry.	0
dia938_utt2.wav	So, do you think you can forgive me?	0
dia938_utt3.wav	Great.	2
dia938_utt4.wav	Thanks.	2
dia938_utt5.wav	Okay, bye.	1
dia938_utt6.wav	Hello, Jennifer?	1
dia938_utt7.wav	Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there?	2
dia938_utt8.wav	Oh, shes not home huh?	0
dia938_utt9.wav	Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.	1
dia939_utt0.wav	Hey!	0
dia939_utt1.wav	Hi.	1
dia939_utt2.wav	Are you all right?	1
dia939_utt3.wav	Uhh… I think I just got engaged.	0
dia939_utt4.wav	Oh my God! He did it?	2
dia939_utt5.wav	Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?	2
dia939_utt6.wav	Are you kidding?	2
dia939_utt7.wav	I’m like the one who talked him into it.	2
dia939_utt8.wav	I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.	0
dia939_utt9.wav	And you really think this is a good idea?	0
dia939_utt10.wav	I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people.	1
dia939_utt11.wav	I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.	0
dia939_utt12.wav	Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so.	2
dia939_utt13.wav	Really?! Even Ross?	0
dia939_utt14.wav	Especially Ross!	2
dia939_utt15.wav	Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’ll come  back later.	1
dia939_utt16.wav	Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just…I’ll  come back.	2
dia939_utt17.wav	There he goes, your fiancée.	2
dia939_utt18.wav	I guess so.	1
dia939_utt19.wav	Although he does play with himself in his sleep.	1
dia939_utt20.wav	I can’t say that I’m surprised.	1
dia940_utt0.wav	Oh, that is so unfortunate.	0
dia940_utt1.wav	What?	1
dia940_utt2.wav	Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.	2
dia940_utt3.wav	Okay, Ill be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe Im sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.	1
dia940_utt4.wav	You didnt leave lipstick marks on the phone.	1
dia940_utt5.wav	Oh, then it mustve been you. Bye.	1
dia940_utt6.wav	Bye-bye!  Thats why I moved out.	2
dia940_utt7.wav	Hey, y'know while were on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you dont live here anymore.	1
dia940_utt8.wav	I think on some levels she already knows.	1
dia941_utt0.wav	Night Mon. Night Julio.	1
dia941_utt1.wav	Adiós.	1
dia941_utt2.wav	Look Julio, someone left their book here.	0
dia941_utt3.wav	Ah actually, that is mine.	1
dia941_utt4.wav	Oh yeah, what are you reading?	1
dia941_utt5.wav	Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?	1
dia941_utt6.wav	Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it?	1
dia941_utt7.wav	I thought I would, but the translation's no good.	1
dia941_utt8.wav	Your a poet and don't know it.	1
dia941_utt9.wav	Actually I ah, I am a poet.	1
dia941_utt10.wav	Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about?	1
dia941_utt11.wav	Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.	1
dia941_utt12.wav	Mine?  Right here?	1
dia941_utt13.wav	I can write an epic poem about this lip.	2
dia941_utt14.wav	How would that go?  Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.	2
dia942_utt0.wav	Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.	1
dia942_utt1.wav	What?	0
dia942_utt2.wav	I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.	1
dia942_utt3.wav	What?	0
dia942_utt4.wav	Were at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?	1
dia942_utt5.wav	Are we really in Montreal?!	0
dia942_utt6.wav	Yes we are. So, coffee?	1
dia942_utt7.wav	Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?	1
dia942_utt8.wav	Oh, no. But its just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.	1
dia943_utt0.wav	Okay, heres batch 22.	1
dia943_utt1.wav	Oh, maybe thesell taste a little like your grandmothers.	0
dia943_utt2.wav	This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.	1
dia943_utt3.wav	Lets give it a shot.	1
dia943_utt4.wav	Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?	2
dia943_utt5.wav	No, just a Friday night.	1
dia944_utt0.wav	Would she?	1
dia944_utt1.wav	Would she?  You ate my candy bar!	0
dia945_utt0.wav	Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.	0
dia945_utt1.wav	I know honey, Im sorry.	0
dia945_utt2.wav	Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because its remotely related to the field theyre interested in.	0
dia945_utt3.wav	Gee, I dont know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!	2
dia945_utt4.wav	Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt....	0
dia945_utt5.wav	I dont mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.	0
dia945_utt6.wav	Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?	0
dia945_utt7.wav	Im sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....	0
dia945_utt8.wav	Its not funny, this is actually my job.	0
dia945_utt9.wav	Oh believe me, I-I-Ive been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.	1
dia945_utt10.wav	Oh well then, so Im just going to go back to talking to my friend here.	2
dia945_utt11.wav	And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.	2
dia945_utt12.wav	Ah, just one other thing.	1
dia945_utt13.wav	Yes?!	2
dia945_utt14.wav	I ah, I work at	1
dia945_utt15.wav	Do you want my pickle?	1
dia946_utt0.wav	Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?	1
dia946_utt1.wav	Why?	0
dia946_utt2.wav	Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.	1
dia946_utt3.wav	Oh my God.	2
dia946_utt4.wav	Phoebe.	1
dia946_utt5.wav	Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.	1
dia946_utt6.wav	Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.	2
dia946_utt7.wav	He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.	0
dia946_utt8.wav	We should do something. Whistle.	2

dia947_utt0.wav	Hi! Umm, Im Monica Geller, Im the chef at Alessandros.	1
dia947_utt1.wav	Still?	0
dia947_utt2.wav	I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.	1
dia947_utt3.wav	I dont see any reason why I would do that to myself again.	2
dia947_utt4.wav	Either eat it, or be in it.	0
dia947_utt5.wav	Spoon?  So, what do you think?	2
dia947_utt6.wav	Im torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.	0
dia947_utt7.wav	Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here.. theres a new class comin in.	2
dia947_utt8.wav	Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?	1
dia947_utt9.wav	I can.	1
dia947_utt10.wav	Okay, go ahead.	1
dia947_utt11.wav	Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.	1
dia947_utt12.wav	Thats very good, whats your name?	1
dia947_utt13.wav	Monica.	1
dia947_utt14.wav	Monica, you go to the head of the class.	1
dia947_utt15.wav	Okay.	2
dia948_utt0.wav	And there's a country called Argentinaaaa,    it's a place I've never seeeeen.	1
dia948_utt1.wav	But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a    human spleen.	1
dia948_utt2.wav	Human spleeeen.	1
dia948_utt3.wav	Olé!	2
dia948_utt4.wav	What are you doing here!	2

dia948_utt6.wav	Great!	2
dia948_utt7.wav	Yeah!	2
dia948_utt8.wav	It really has been great too, you know, some of this people    must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs!	2
dia948_utt9.wav	"Yeah, ""You suck"" and ""shut up and go home""."	2
dia948_utt10.wav	Listen Phoebe...	2
dia948_utt11.wav	Yeah.	1

dia948_utt14.wav	This is kind of a classy place.	1
dia948_utt15.wav	Ok, say no more.	1
dia949_utt0.wav	I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.	0
dia949_utt1.wav	Well, I've brought some books. We could read.	1
dia949_utt2.wav	Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.	2
dia949_utt3.wav	Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!	2
dia949_utt4.wav	I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention	1
dia949_utt5.wav	Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?	1
dia949_utt6.wav	We can't. We're not pharmacists!	0
dia949_utt7.wav	I know we're not, but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba...	1

dia983_utt2.wav	Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!	0
dia983_utt3.wav	I know! Im sorry! The guys drunk, they wont let me go until we get this.	0
dia983_utt4.wav	Oh my God! Im gonna have to find another minister.	0
dia983_utt5.wav	No! No, Im the minister! Alright, look-look, put em both on the phone, Ill marry them right now.	0
dia983_utt6.wav	Ugh! Joey, I have to go.	0
dia983_utt7.wav	Hey! Dont you hang up on me! Ill marry you and me right now! I have the power!	0
dia984_utt0.wav	Oh hey Joey! What's up?	2
dia984_utt1.wav	I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?	1
dia984_utt2.wav	Yeah, I've been around.	1
dia984_utt3.wav	Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?	1
dia984_utt4.wav	Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees.	1
dia984_utt5.wav	Great! Problem solved!	2
dia985_utt0.wav	Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.	0
dia985_utt1.wav	All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.	1
dia985_utt2.wav	Why?	0
dia985_utt3.wav	Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.	0
dia985_utt4.wav	Bastard!	0
dia986_utt0.wav	You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping orOh!	2
dia986_utt1.wav	All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!	2
dia986_utt2.wav	Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.	2
dia986_utt3.wav	Oh, I can't believe it!	2
dia986_utt4.wav	I mean I think it's great!	2
dia986_utt5.wav	For him.	1
dia986_utt6.wav	She might be able to do better.	1
dia986_utt7.wav	Hey guys!	1
dia986_utt8.wav	Joey! Come here! Come here!	1
dia986_utt9.wav	Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.	1
dia986_utt10.wav	You mean how they're friends and nothing more?	1
dia986_utt11.wav	No. Joey, she	1
dia986_utt12.wav	Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?	2
dia986_utt13.wav	Yes, but y'know what?	1
dia986_utt14.wav	It doesn't matter who knows what.	1
dia986_utt15.wav	Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!	1
dia986_utt16.wav	Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!	2
dia987_utt0.wav	It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.	1
dia988_utt0.wav	Yknow, youre friends getting married, its gotta change things.	1
dia988_utt1.wav	You really think it would be that different?	0
dia988_utt2.wav	How could it not be?	0
dia988_utt3.wav	I mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.	0
dia988_utt4.wav	And then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a	0
dia988_utt5.wav	Well, things change.	1
dia988_utt6.wav	I dont want them to move to a	0
dia988_utt7.wav	Itll be okay Joe.	1
dia989_utt0.wav	Its still there!	2
dia989_utt1.wav	Mrs. Braverman must be out.	1
dia989_utt2.wav	She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.	0
dia989_utt3.wav	By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.	0
dia989_utt4.wav	No that could kill her.	0
dia989_utt5.wav	Well, we dont want that.	1
dia989_utt6.wav	No, so were protecting her.	1
dia989_utt7.wav	But we should take it.	1
dia989_utt8.wav	But we should move quick.	0
dia989_utt9.wav	Why?	0
dia989_utt10.wav	Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.	0
dia989_utt11.wav	Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!	0
dia990_utt0.wav	Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?	1
dia990_utt1.wav	Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.	1
dia990_utt2.wav	Well, you're gonna.	1
dia990_utt3.wav	I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...	1
dia990_utt4.wav	Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?	1
dia990_utt5.wav	Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.	1
dia990_utt6.wav	And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?	0
dia990_utt7.wav	Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...	1
dia990_utt8.wav	Hey, you're not him.	1
dia990_utt9.wav	You're you.	1
dia990_utt10.wav	When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?	1
dia990_utt11.wav	No.	1
dia990_utt12.wav	No.	1
dia990_utt13.wav	You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.	1
dia990_utt14.wav	Now that wasn't easy, but you did it!	1
dia990_utt15.wav	"And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married."""	1
dia990_utt16.wav	You really think so?	2
dia990_utt17.wav	Yeah. I really do.	1
dia990_utt18.wav	Thanks, Chandler.	1
dia990_utt19.wav	Get off!	0
dia991_utt0.wav	Hi.	1
dia991_utt1.wav	Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?	1
dia991_utt2.wav	When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?	1
dia991_utt3.wav	And the cream?	1
dia991_utt4.wav	Cheese makes me thirsty.	1
dia991_utt5.wav	Okay. Lets move on.	1
dia991_utt6.wav	All right.	1
dia991_utt7.wav	Oh! Something smells good over at Monicas station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! Youve never made this before?	2
dia991_utt8.wav	Oh no!	2
dia991_utt9.wav	I dont know anything about cooking.	1
dia991_utt10.wav	I had to ask someone what its called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.	1
dia991_utt11.wav	Well, hats off to the chef.	2
dia991_utt12.wav	I-I-Im sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didnt hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?	1
dia991_utt13.wav	The chef!	2
dia991_utt14.wav	Thats right.	2
dia992_utt0.wav	Hey, Pheebs.	1
dia992_utt1.wav	Hey.	1
dia992_utt2.wav	How's it going?	1
dia992_utt3.wav	Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.	2
dia992_utt4.wav	So what's going on?	1
dia992_utt5.wav	Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.	1
dia992_utt6.wav	I dunno, there's just something about...	1
dia992_utt7.wav	Basically we just feel that he's...	1
dia992_utt8.wav	We hate that guy.	0
dia992_utt9.wav	Yeah. Hate him.	0
dia992_utt10.wav	We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.	0
dia992_utt11.wav	Uh-huh.	1
dia992_utt12.wav	Okay.	1
dia992_utt13.wav	Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?	1
dia992_utt14.wav	...No, we hate him.	0
dia992_utt15.wav	We're sorry.	0
dia993_utt0.wav	Hey!	2
dia993_utt1.wav	Hey!	2
dia993_utt2.wav	What are you doing?	1
dia993_utt3.wav	Im sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.	1
dia994_utt0.wav	Yes that was mine.	0
dia994_utt1.wav	Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.	1
dia994_utt2.wav	Yes that would have made more sense.	0
dia994_utt3.wav	Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man!	0
dia994_utt4.wav	All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time.	1
dia994_utt5.wav	And whatever you say, I'll believe ya.	1
dia994_utt6.wav	Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?	0
dia995_utt0.wav	Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?	0
dia995_utt1.wav	Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.	1
dia996_utt0.wav	She said what?	0
dia996_utt1.wav	"She said, ""If Im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."""	1
dia996_utt2.wav	Postpone it?	2
dia996_utt3.wav	Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?	0
dia996_utt4.wav	Do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?	0
dia996_utt5.wav	This isnt right.	1
dia996_utt6.wav	I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, Im sure theyll come back when we can do it right.	0
dia996_utt7.wav	I cant ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?	0
dia996_utt8.wav	Dont you point your pants at me!	0
dia996_utt9.wav	We have no choice!	0
dia996_utt10.wav	Anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, Ross dont you understand?	0
dia996_utt11.wav	This is our wedding Im talking about.	0
dia996_utt12.wav	The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This is when were getting married.	1
dia996_utt13.wav	So what are you saying? Its now or never?	0
dia996_utt14.wav	No. Im saying its now.	1
dia996_utt15.wav	Or?	0
dia996_utt16.wav	Theres no or in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!	0
dia996_utt17.wav	Its not the pants.	0
dia996_utt18.wav	Its you that is backwards.	0
dia996_utt19.wav	And if, and if you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldnt get married at all!	0
dia996_utt20.wav	No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please	0
dia997_utt0.wav	Hi, honey.	1
dia997_utt1.wav	See you later.	1
dia997_utt2.wav	What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!	2
dia997_utt3.wav	Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!	0
dia997_utt4.wav	Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. Im calling for Monica Geller.	1
dia997_utt5.wav	Oh no!	0
dia997_utt6.wav	I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available	1

dia999_utt4.wav	But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.	1
dia1000_utt0.wav	Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!	0
dia1000_utt1.wav	Have you ever seen so much crap?	0
dia1000_utt2.wav	Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap	0

dia1001_utt1.wav	I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti.	1
dia1001_utt2.wav	All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office.	1
dia1001_utt3.wav	It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.	2
dia1001_utt4.wav	If it's not you, this is a horrible story.	0
dia1001_utt5.wav	Fortunately, it is me.	2
dia1001_utt6.wav	And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much.	2
dia1001_utt7.wav	Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate.	2
dia1001_utt8.wav	Y'know, someplace nice.	1
dia1001_utt9.wav	Yeah, someplace nice.	1
dia1001_utt10.wav	Yeah!	2
dia1001_utt11.wav	How much do you think I can get for my kidney?	1
dia1002_utt0.wav	So, what do you think?	1
dia1002_utt1.wav	I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.	2

dia1003_utt1.wav	Gotcha.	1
dia1003_utt2.wav	This place is really my Grandmothers.	1
dia1003_utt3.wav	I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this.	1
dia1003_utt4.wav	So if the landlord ever asks, Im 87 year old woman, whos afraid of her VCR.	1
dia1003_utt5.wav	So are you thirsty?	1

dia1005_utt12.wav	But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.	1
dia1005_utt13.wav	Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!	0
dia1005_utt14.wav	Okay, stop!	0
dia1005_utt15.wav	Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy?	1
